Through out the semester I have worked with the applicant on various group projects and have seen him excel in his first semester at Tech. ,"The applicant has a very grasp of a person's personality and is able to use that to his advantage. He is also a great listener and is able to come up with diverse solutions. I think this aspect of him will really help excel in this positions and deal with residents and their issues easily. He adds worth to a relationship by being aware of and being able to assimilate the situation. This also makes him a very approachable person since knowing that I can just talk to him about anything and everything. Secondly, the applicant does a good job at keeping personal and professional roles apart. And I believe this will help him develop a good community on his floor, but also carry out the house keeping duties in a professional manner.",I believe that this applicant has a habit of sticking hard to the deadline and this is something he requires of those around him as well. He is a very timely person and likes doing things in advance - this is an area where his work still tends to clash with those of others. The way he might approach others to get the task done in the most effective way is something he can work on  and I believe this is something he will learn very easily on the job.,This applicant will work best in the RA position with upperclassmen. I believe this applicant works well with people  who give him feedback about his tasks and appreciate his efforts and give him the same respect that he gives others. He works least well with people who don't tell him if he is doing something wrong or not - this usually makes him feel unclear about if what he is doing is efficient and working or if he needs to change up things.,"I believe this applicant will make a great SSM because of his ability to be a good listener, a timely person, disciplined about his responsibilities but also having the energy to encourage excitement in those around him - all of which will help him build a good balanced community around him.",,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Yes,None

He has many friends and seems to get along great with them. They are from different states backgrounds ethnicities. ,"From the moment I met Ashal, I thought he had the energy that I think makes a great PL.

He is incredibly hardworking to achieve his passions, and is very determined when he needs to complete a task. He would be able to respect someone's difficult journey, and is definitely strong with regards to personal development.","The applicant would need to develop assisting others with their passions and putting others before himself. He appears more focused regarding his own passions than about other peoples passions. While he is incredibly determined at achieving his own tasks, I feel that may hinder his ability to actively put others before him and sacrifice his own work and passions to assist others. Likewise, I feel he could use further development regarding social interaction with people whose interests are not similar to his own.","I feel this applicant would be better with upperclass students. This is because upperclassman typically need less guidance than freshman students, and therefore Abhirav would be able to act as a resource and a friendly liason, while assiting with events. He works best with quieter, calmer students and works less better with overly-energetic personalities.","I do believe the candidate would make a good SSM. Abhriav contains the event coordination skills, organizational skills, and personal determination to be a good SSM. However, he would need to develop better social skills interacting with personalities unlike his own, and putting his own interests aside to help others in order to be a truly effective SSM.",,Good,Excellent,Average,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Average,Good,Good,Excellent,"Yes, but with reservations",N A

We worked together closely for 3 years.,"In my 30 years of working in education, Aditya may be the most complete and balanced student with whom I've worked. He represented our school and Aruba as a spokesperson both locally and internationally when he participated in a world youth conference in Switzerland. Aditya has the ability to communicate clearly, with patience and understanding to varied audiences. He seems equally at home working with small children as a tutor to advising government officials on policy adoption. He is well respected by his peers for his non-confrontational and highly productive approach to finding solutions to challenging problems. He seems perfectly matched for the position as I understand it. ","Whenever Aditya feels he has a weakness or area in which he wants to improve, he dedicates himself toward that improvement. I'm struggling to make a suggestion, but if pressed to identify an area for continued development, Aditya can work more on matching his writing ability to his speaking ability. His public presentation is stronger than his writing.","You can place him with any type of student and he will be successful. Use him as needed. Because he has high expectations for himself, he may work best with other motivated students and eventually lose patience with non motivated students, but I've never seen the limits of his patience.","I believe he will excel if given the opportunity. His personality seems a perfect match for dealing with any situation that comes up. He will find mutually beneficial solutions, while avoiding escalation in contentious situations. He is top shelf.","Contact me if I can be of any more assistance: dwilleford@isaruba.com When Aditya graduated last year, he created a huge hole in our student leadership.

12 29 2015  6:24:00 PM,Aksal Vashi,Abhi Goswami,President and Manager of Georgia Tech Qurbani,abhi.kgoswami@gatech.edu,non Residence Life Staff Recommendation,Current or Former Supervisor,N A,I have known Aksal for approximately a year.,"Aksal is one of the most organized and enthusiastic freshmen I have ever met at Georgia Tech. Not only does he excel academically but since day one he has always asked me,'How can I help?' pertaining to anything with the team. I have had the opportunity of mentoring him both as a dancer and as a student here at Tech and I can say that his ability to handle dancing, volunteering to help with managerial work, academic, clubs, and still have time for a decent amount of free time is surprising to say the least. Away from his actual ability, I find his personality to be the most telling. For as long as I have known him, he never been afraid to come up to a new person and say hello or even just smile and say 'hi' in his cheerful style as he walks by them. I think what is even more telling of Aksal is that when thinking of what to write for this recommendation I realized that everyone I know of that he could've asked to write this recommendation would only have positive things to say about him. Aksal knows what it means to work as a team and I have first hand seen him find ways to make even the toughest rules set forward by heads of the team become understandable to some of the unwilling freshmen dancers (ex food rules before competitions). Aksal is a natural leader with a penchant for compassion and fairness for everyone. I see Aksal being a great asset both for Georgia Tech administration and student residents.","I believe the best way that Aksal can improve is by leading groups of people significantly older than him. This is why I feel like he would be a much more successful with first-years. Around students and people who are more than a year older than him I've noticed he tends to be more quiet. Until he gets to know them somewhat well, he tends to just stay with his smile, 'hiello', and casual conversation; although he is outwardly only a little less bubbly around new, older people I can tell he can be less comfortable. That said, I feel that through an SSM-like experience he would grow in that way. Also, there are times where he isn't as confident as I feel like he can be in himself; he is a very intelligent, talented, and humble young man who still has a lot of potential to grow.","Aksal would be extremely successful with first-years but I could clearly see him succeeding with older students. His personality is always upbeat, bubbly, and vibrant; he has quickly made friends on many dance teams around Georgia Tech and at other schools just by going up to them and talking to them for a few minutes. I have seen Aksal work very well with almost all personalities; whenever I see him he is always interacting with anyone from the boisterous, very active type to the shy, more reserved type. That said he also has a great ability to conduct himself in a very professional manner when helping to represent our team. The only group of people I have seen him have trouble creating very close connections with are very apathetic individuals, and I'm not sure I can blame him for that  (and for clarification, apathetic is very distinct from reserved).","Without reservation, yes. I am jealous of the incoming freshmen that will have the opportunity to receive mentoring and support from Aksal as they transition into the Georgia Tech community.  I don't know very many guys that are as able to talk about both the very serious topics and the fun and easy going areas of life in the same conversation without the slightest bit of discomfort. I remember when he directly talked out a conflict between some younger team members and then hilariously started talking with one of them about balancing a potential relationship and his classes. Even when he has felt poorly emotionally and has come talked to me about whatever was going on, he never once 'shares that negative energy' (as he calls it) to other people. Whenever I see him regardless of the circumstances, he is always full of energy and has an extra smile to give you. He is a team player and never rests until the job is done and done well. Finally he is very weird; in the best way possible. He literally listens to every genre of music (I'm not joking: country, rap, EDM, Hindi, pop, bhangra... The list goes on), he has been involved with or knows someone involved with most activities imaginable, he's very knowledgeable about every major world sport I know of, and he likes watching the most obscure documentaries. There is no student that Aksal wouldn't be able to counsel and support in his (and really, even 'her') transition into Georgia Tech life.","Aksal never strives to just complete a task; he always looks to do his best and whenever you see the end result, his hard work clearly distinguishes itself just from what is expected. Along with that, I see Aksal as a life-long learner. He always want to learn what I do to help make the team learn and whenever he makes a mistake whether during dance, school, or whatever he always comes and asks both what he did (I assume to get an outside opinion) and how he can improve from then. Aksal started out as a pretty bad dancer but he has yet to make the same mistake twice and now he is growing to be a young leader on the team. I see Aksal being very similar as a PL or RA, except he would come in with all the attributes and skills needed.",Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,"No, everything has already been addressed."

","Her experience as a Dance Marathon Moral leader and Alpha Chi Greek Week Chair (Leading her team to an overall win) demonstrate her ability to motivate students to participate and get involved, as an RA would with hall programs. As the VP of Facility Operations for her sorority, Alex was in charge of a house of 34 residents, coordinating the housing facilityâ€™s maintenance and ensuring resident safety by having practice fire drills and reviewing the security system procedures.   Alex also possesses great creativity in her problem solving, she continually approaches situations from different angles to find the most effective way of solving it. During her time as VP of Housing Operations it was mandated that residents assist in cleaning the facility. Alex created a system to minimize cleaning time, grouped residents together so they would stay engaged, and played music and had snacks during the event making it more of a social event than a chore. ",Alex's areas of development for an SSM position could include that she has not lived on campus for the past year so she would need to familiarize herself with GT housing layouts again.,"Alex would work well with all ages, she has friends in a wide variety of age groups. As a CS major I have seen her do a lot of group work and she works well with outgoing personalities as well as with those who are more quiet. I believe she would be most successful as an RA as she will be a 5th year next year. ","I believe Alex Link would be an asset to any SSM staff she is on. I have had the pleasure of knowing her personally and professionally working on an Executive board with her. She is reliable, thoughtful, fun, and creative.

I first became acquainted with Alex when he reached out to me (in his first semester at GT) with (great!) suggestions for the Honors Program and a request for a meeting with me to discuss.  I later recruited Alex to serve in our first cohort of  Honors Program Triple Leaders to lead & mentor a group of  freshmen Honors Program students in the 2015-16 entering class. I have also met with Alex on several occasions since fall 2014 to brainstorm strategize ideas for the Honors Program.","Alex is a deeply nice and kind person who cares about others and respects them in all their diversity.  He is a sincere person--no hidden agendas or phony friendliness. He has a lively, imaginative, creative, problem-solving mind and temperament. He is endlessly energetic, can-do, and upbeat. He is a natural leader of the best kind--people respect and follow him because he radiates optimism, enthusiasm, friendliness, and support & respect for others. He is quick on his feet and very good in a crunch (when we hit snags in our Honors Program Retreat in fall 2015, Alex was one of the Triple Leaders who stepped up, analyzed the problems & potential solutions, and executed the solutions with skill and no drama).","I haven't encountered shortcomings in Alex. If I were to guess at the chief challenge for any person with Alex's energy and enthusiasm level it would be working with those who are less so. My hunch is that Alex is one of the energetic enthusiastic types of people who also has so much compassion, kindness, and respect for others by his nature, that he would actually be good at understanding and supporting  those who are different from him.","As suggested in my answer to question 10,  I have not seen any shortcomings in Alex that would suggest a problem connecting with all kinds of first-years. I suspect he would relate immediately to people like him and, due to his warm and friendly temperament & character, with all others as well.","I believe Alex would make an excellent SSM! In addition to all the strengths detailed above (Question 10), Alex would be someone that housing residence life could always rely on--both to generate the positive energy that makes for a great Tech experience for our students, and to come through in a crunch when difficulties arise (his maturity & personal responsibility quotients, in my observation, are very high).","In addition to all of the above, Alex is a great and fun person to know and work with!

I recall standing next to Alex by a bus filled with first-year Honors Program students we were conveying to their Retreat venue. This was after we had to improvise to solve  a problem that had arisen, and Alex's input and operationalization were key to the solution. I spontaneously said to him something like, 'I am so glad I recruited you, Alex, thank you!' He smiled in a warm, modest, appreciative way, and said something like 'Of course, I'm so happy to do this.' Alex is a person I would always want on my team."

It may be a growing experience for her to have to speak up as a leader, but I think she is absolutely up for it.

She does have that motivation and desire for community and wants to help create it!","Alexandra told me that she would love to be an RA in Woodruff. She loves that they have to only share a bathroom with 1-3 people, but also likes that students are not in apartments.  She realizes that apartment floors are much less social, and wants to really have community. If she cannot mention her preference for Woodies, she would still like to be an RA.

Because she is not the 'loud assertive person' in a social group, it would be better for her to not have freshmen who need more guidance, discipline, etc. But I believe in her capability to move outside what is comfortable for disciplining when necessary.   Personalities...she would work well with nearly anyone honestly..she is really open and kind. I guess she would work least well with aggressive and unkind people."," I really do. She really holds a very high regard for the position of a SSM - she has seen the impact an RA can have on students' experience here, and really wants to make a difference. She had an amazing RA last year (Kelsey), and this year, her experience really hasn't been so positive. She really has a heart for having a community within the residence hall - which is really optimistic, and I think she has seen both really good, and not so good SSMs, so it is significant that she still has this hope and goal. Alexandra is very approachable and kind. She would be an asset to any staff.",,Average,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,"Alexandra is a really wonderful person. I think this would be such a good opportunity for her...she would appreciate it so much - which would make her so much better at the job than a good portion of the other applicants.

She is not extremely busy, so she would be very present for her residents. "

(2014-2015) Throughout her employment at my learning facility, I personally trained and guided her in her position as a teaching assistant. She became an important member in my staff as she was consistent in her attendance (3-4 days per week) and proved potential in her abilities through managing her responsibilities in a way many others could not.","I have many expectations for my staff, and Alexandra exceeded, if not exemplified to others, the roles expected of an assistant. She played a pivotal role in hundreds of students' learning in the way she communicated clearly their needs to her supervisors and parents, managed her time efficiently, and presented herself as a caring, concerned member of our staff. She was able to multi-task despite the high volume of work depending on her.   Having dealt with students, ages 4-16, as well as their parents, I have no doubt that Alexandra is an individual who has a special leadership ability no matter the circumstances. I am convinced that she would be an excellent addition to the Student Staff.","Of course, with her many strengths, it is foolish to say that one has no need for improvement. The first few months of her employment, Alexandra received my requests and constructive criticisms with such optimism and an open-mind. I saw many of her weaknesses grow to become her strengths as her time with us came to an end.  Time and feedback is a huge factor in the work that I do. I will be happy to see Alexandra develop her ability in concision, which she has improved immensely on from the start of her employment. It is an important skill to learn in life as well as a potential SSM. In guiding fellow students, Alexandra may not have the time she desires to bring influence to her peers. Through finding the brief words and actions to be all the powerful will be a great asset to her in the Student Staff. ","Like I mentioned earlier, Alexandra has worked with it all from young students (just out of diapers!) to difficult teenage students who have yet to find their passion to overbearing parents expecting to see the impossible become a possibility. I think I can most see Alexandra make the most difference among the underclass students, her own peers. Her confidence and drive is evident in the way she completes any task. Among fellow assistants who were of the same age during her time working for me, I could see that Alexandra's voice was valued and her opinions mattered.","Yes, Alexandra will make not only a good SSM but a valuable one. It is not often that I praise my previous employees- Alexandra being an exception. She will always a special ingredient in a large crowd through her contagious personality, refusal to accept just an 'average,' and openness to learn and grow. ",,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,My recommendation may not have done its justice in depicting my satisfaction and gratefulness of Alexandra's time at my learning facility.

If someone new approaches him, he will be very sociable, but I have not often seen him take the first step to connect with others.","I think Alex would be successful with both first-years and upperclass students, but more so with upperclass students. This is because I feel that first-years would need someone who needs to reach out to them more, and that is an area in which he needs improvement.","I think Alex's ability to be social, kind, and understanding will make him a good SSM.

We've interacted through a couple of classes taken together and also through our time on Exec together.   I would like to note that I am writing this recommendation as her 'current supervisor' and not has a SSM. ,"Alexis is a strong willed, passionate, and an extremely bright individual. Her intelligence is unmatched but there is also a quirky fun side to her that you wouldn't have guessed could come out of someone like her. She cares very deeply for her academics and for the people she is surrounded by. Through my interactions, I could see how much time she would put into helping someone in need. She has a strong sense of justice and tries her best to uphold her morals values. Alexis can bring so much creativity to this job and to her residents. She has a way of seeing things like no one else is viewing them. I believe this stems from her passion and pure talent for art and drawing. Side note: She is an amazing artist and her work should be displayed in museums! When Alexis is given a task to complete during our Exec Meetings, she is always so prepared and gets the task done without hesitation. Her work is impeccable and most always, she'll go above and beyond what is asked of her. And above all, her willingness to sacrifice her own desires in order to help others is a defining trait that will make her a great SSM.   I full heartedly give my support to Alexis as she applies to be an SSM. She is honestly one of the best people that could be applying this cycle. If you have any further questions, or I can help explain more about Alexis, please reach out to me. I would be more than happy to spend my day talking about how great Alexis is!","Alexis could improve on her ability to not put so much pressure on herself. She takes her job and academics seriously - which is not a bad thing at all! But often times, she will put so much pressure on herself that she ends up not being able to see the bigger picture of everything. I know that being an SSM will be a challenge that she is capable of taking on and learning from. Housing could definitely help her see the bigger picture of a situation. ","I believe that Alexis would work well with any type of student! But I definitely see her working more with first year students. I believe that my answer in number 9 fully details her personality traits that could help benefit the first years. But to recap, Alexis is one of the most hard-working, caring, and dedicated students on this campus. It will be hard to find someone who is so willing to give her all to the residents. She is open in a way that makes you feel comfortable to talk with her about what's on your mind, and allows herself to be readily available to anyone who is in need of a chat. ","Yes. 100% yes. Through my experience with her on Exec, I know that she is so dedicated to her work and will give her all to this position. She is not your typical 'yell loud and be crazy' SSM, but rather one that is more reserved, but equally as tenacious and passionate about her work. She is going to make a great addition to the housing staff!","I full heartedly give my support to Alexis as she applies to be an SSM.

She plans programs on her own and she helps out her peers. ",First year students.  She works well with almost any type of person. She is very approachable and friendly.  The type of personality she'd work the least well with though would likely be someone with a never-ending bad attitude.,"Yes! I think Alexis is a wonderful programmer, full of creativity and endless ideas. Additionally she is very genuine and caring when she interacts with others.

She has previously worked as a camp counselor for special education children; through this role, Alexis has experienced a variety of situations and has been able to develop strong critical thinking and crisis management skills. ","This role would allow her to interact with diversity social justice issues in a safe environment, which I do not believe she has had a large opportunity to interact with.

He would be able to work collaboratively with the other Georgia Tech student leaders. He is very enthusiastic and of high moral character. He is a calm and intelligent young man who could help the student residents get situated at the college.,"Allan would gain much by participating in the SSM program. In all the aforementioned requirements, I believe that Allan can excel. In terms of an area that I may feel that Allan can develop more in, I would choose conflict mediation simply because he would not willingly engage in conflict. However, I believe that he could do a great job in helping people resolve their problems. ","I cannot foresee any type of students that Allan would have trouble working with. Allan grew up in a very racially diverse, lower income neighborhood in Tennessee. However, his high school had many upperclass students. Allan made friendships with all types of students, conflicting with none.","I firmly believe that Allan will make an excellent SSM. He would benefit greatly from this program as it would allow him to continue to develop as a leader. Furthermore, he would provide a great example to the Georgia Tech students of what a successful student can be.","Allan was a great soccer player for my soccer team. He excelled on the field but as important he showed remarkable dedication to the team. Our school did not have a soccer field on site and thus all interested players had to find their own transportation to and from games and practices. Allan's parents were not able to provide him with a ride. Allan would ride Nashville's inadequate bus system home from practices regularly, often these rides and walks would take hours. He never once complained about his hardship, using the time to work on his studies. He is a very admirable figure and one whom will make Georgia Tech proud.",Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Yes,Willing to speak via phone or email with more information about Allan.

She can also be incredibly mature when faced with a serious situation. When another girl on the floor was throwing up in the bathroom and I asked her to help me clear out the space, she respectfully asked the other girls to leave the bathroom so that I could help out the sick resident and the situation would be calmer. I believe her ability to manage stressful situations like this could translate well to emergency duty calls.

I know her pretty well.,"Amy is outgoing, approachable, and funny. I think that residents would be comfortable talking to her and going to her for advice. She is also creative and has some good ideas for hall events.",Something Amy could work on is handling criticism from her peers and not taking things personally. I think this applies to the SSM position because sometimes resident's don't want anything to do with you and you have to do your best to not take it personally and try to include them anyways. Amy is working on handling this better.,"I think that Amy would be most successful with first-year students because she is involved and wants to offer more guidance and help serve as a resource for new students to be acclimated. I think that she would work best with light-hearted personalities because she is a funny outgoing person, but she can also be serious when she needs to.","I believe that Amy would make a good SSM because she is a positive and hard-working person. She would be able to handle her academics, social life, and this job. She definitely has a great presence on our hall and I think she would do a wonderful job in creating a community.","Amy has some good ideas for events. One idea that stood out to me was an event right before bid day to include the greek students in a hall activity. I'm not involved in greek life, but I know it was a struggle getting greek residents who are rushing involved in the hall at the beginning of the year because of all the rush events, so I thought this was a good idea.",Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Yes,N A

I have also been in the same TAH   GLC intramural flag football and soccer team with Anant.,"Anant has several qualifications that in my mind would allow him to succeed as an RA. I elaborate these qualifications as follows. First of all, I think that Anant is very easily approachable person making it easy for him to build personal relationships with other people. In all my events, Anant has always been interested in making meaningful connections with the other residents. I also think that Anant is also highly empathetic person and would truly care for the well-being of the residents in his area. Second, I think that Anant really enjoys the resident life and would contribute to it. Anant has actively participated in all the events that I have organized often being the first one to arrive and the last one to leave. In several of my events, Anant has even volunteered to help out preparing and serving food, etc. sometimes spending considerably amount of his free time. Anant has also been a core member of the Tenth & Home and GLC flag football and soccer teams by taking part to all the training sessions and games. With other residents, Anant even made a bill for the Hall Council to get funds for an after game meal for our intramural team. Based on my knowledge on Anant’s background, he has not only been extremely successful in academics but also has shown leadership in a large variety of extracurricular activities. Because of this, I think that Anant would make a great role model for the residents in his area. I also believe that Anant would actively encourage his residents to both succeed in academics and pursue extracurricular activities. Based on these and other qualifications of Anant, I am confident that he would make an excellent RA, a supportive member of his RA team, and a reliable asset to his Hall Director.",I think that Anant could learn a great deal from the RA position but I am not aware of any specific areas that he would need to develop in order to succeed as an RA.,"I think that Anant would be the most successful RA with graduate students (Tenth & Home or GLC) since he is a graduate student himself.

Last year, we both were on different committees. This year, I am director and I have direct involvement with him and his actions and impacts on our organization. ","Ananth is the most social person I have ever met. He is extremely friendly and outgoing and isn't afraid to go out of his comfort zone to meet new friends and make them feel welcome. His position on A-Town Showdown board is Head Liaison. A-town showdown is a intercollegiate dance competition hosted at Georgia Tech! His task is to recruit 36 liaisons to help take care of 350+ dancers who come to Atlanta for 3 days. Once he interviews over 60 candidates and recruits 36 of them, it is his job for 5 months to make sure they are prepared and educated on all the logistics of show weekend ensuring that everyone stays on task and on time as well as ensuring all 36 liaisons feel comfortable. He is extremely friendly and approachable whenever these liaisons have monetary issues, or have disputes with other liaisons. He is also responsible for coordinating social events to make sure all the liaisons are engaged and are having fun throughout the five months they are with us. He leads three meetings which last 4-5 hours each in which he goes over crucial information pertaining to our dance competition and is one of our strongest leaders. He isn't afraid to speak up and give his opinions when we are having group discussions and he is always respectful with other people's opinions. ","Ananth always creates detailed schedules and sticks to his logistical schedules ensuring he always completes all of his goals on time. I would say his areas of development would be to make sure he can fit all requirements onto his schedule. I'm not sure what his extra curriculars are like for next year. Making sure his workload is appropriate to make time for residents. In his first year of being head liaison, he had a heavy school workload and thus was a little less prepared to interview liaisons. But the following year, he caught his mistake and planned ahead for his schedule to have time for interview preparations. He constantly is growing and learning and has matured to learn how to manage his schedule better. I would definitely ask him of his extra curriculars for the following year! ","Ananth would work well with all types of residents. Ananth's liaisons are an amalgam of freshman, sophomore, juniors and seniors and he is able to lead them to success in our organization. I have no doubt in my mind that he can relate to any crowd he is placed in and he is a very strong candidate for your position. He relates well to all crowds. I believe that he specifically enjoys the upperclass students crowd more as he is able to relate more closely with them. He works well with mature, strong personalities. ","I believe Ananth would make an excellent SSM. He fits all of your requirements as he is extremely friendly and approachable, he knows how to organize formal and informal events, he definitely knows how to mediate interpersonal conflicts (monetary conflicts between liaisons), and knows how to bring a smile to everyones faces with his contagious personality. He is very liked by all of his liaisons as well as his fellow exec board members! ","Ananth is responsible, kind, caring, genuine, smart, funny, outgoing, and creative. He puts his heart into everything he commits to and is extremely passionate in everything he does. He does not give up when things get tough and he tries to come up with solutions.",Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,I believe I have covered everything!

We were on the club tennis team together. I was also a liaison for the ATS Dance Competition and he was head liaison so I reported to him. ,Ananth is a very social person who shows a lot of empathy towards others. He is one of the most caring people that I know. He always puts others before him and gives his 110% no matter what task he is assigned. ,"Ananth is outgoing and social but sometimes needs guidance with leadership structure. He hasn't been involved in too many leadership roles to my knowledge. However, he has excelled at everything I have seen him do and do not doubt his ability to do so in such a leadership role. ","He would be mostly good with upper-class residents. From the moment I have met him, Ananth was the most heartfelt and cherishing person I have known. He is always looking for ways to drop what he is doing just so he can reach out and help others. He has done this on countless occasions for my friends and I. He has experience with a lot of the things that RAs already do from professional development to maintaining a healthy environment for upperclassmen to truly succeed. ","I truly believe that Ananth will make for a fantastic SSM biased on all my experiences. He has knowledge of all the resources on campus and is really able to break down various scenarios in his community. Not only I, but any of his friends can vouch for how great of a help Ananth is to us. ",He would be a terrific applicant that deserves to spread his service to others in the housing department. ,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Average,Excellent,Average,Excellent,Good,Yes,"Besides leadership, Ananth is a truly wonderful individual whom I have no qualms about. I have no doubt that he will exceed the expectations that any HD has of their SSM. "

She was my resident for the 2014-2015 Academic Year.,Andrea's strengths are that she is very enthusiastic and personable. Every time I talked to her I felt comfortable and able to relate to her.,"As a SSM, Andrea would need to develop her skills as an authority figure. Her ability to make friends easily and bring humor into a situation would be balanced with the administrative aspects of the SSM role.","While I think Andrea would work well with any type of person, I think she is most suited to being a PL for first year students.

She is an excellent person to ask questions to because if she doesn't know the answer she will find and ask someone who does. She is very capable of handling responsibilities and ensuring that tasks are completed well and on time. ,The only concern I might have is time commitment because Andrea is already involved with many clubs on Tech's campus including some she manages herself. But if she feels up for the task of taking on more responsibility I'm sure she can handle it.,Andrea would do an excellent job working with first-year students and underclassmen. She has a varied background being out of state but also having been born in a different country. She is great at connecting with people and getting to know them. And her involvement with multiple clubs on campus givers her great opportunities to get other students interested in clubs and groups. I have never known Andrea to not be able to befriend someone so she would work well with just about any students. ,Andrea would make a wonderful SSM. Her personality is bright and very friendly. She enjoys connecting with people and she is a very capable planner and event manager. I believe she would be a very approachable and responsible ssm for any all students she is in charge of. ,"Andrea was born and lived in Venezuela for many years before moving to Florida for high school, and she also is currently completing a semester abroad in Spain.

She is very kind and compassionate. She makes an effort to get to know other residents and have conversations with them. She was also very active at events which makes me think that she will be great at programming. She is also dedicated to everything she does and will be very dedicated to the SSM position. ,Andreina will need to learn how to make sure to take care of herself so that she can then poor into others. This comes with the transition to college anyways. She will also need to learn how to have authority over others even when they're friends. ,I believe Andreina would be most successful with any resident but especially first years.

This past semester, Andres has been a full-time student while interning part-time at the Carter Center and has succeeded tremendously in both roles. Since I have known him, Andres has worked while taking classes, but he has never let his busy schedule get in the way of his academic success. Andres is also an Ivan Allen ambassador and is a great mentor for high school juniors and seniors interested in the Ivan Allen school of liberal arts. Andres has also spent a semester in Chile and his family is from Venezuela so he is extremely comfortable in culturally diverse environments.","The SSM position would allow Andres to further develop his tremendous leadership skills and it would allow Andres to grow in more areas than areas pertaining to international affairs and liberal arts as these have been his areas of involvement thus far. The position would allow Andres to become involved in other areas of campus, areas in which I have no doubt he would succeed.","Since Andres is becoming a graduate student in the fall 2016, I have no doubt he would work greatly with graduate students and upperclass students. Andres works best with involved and outgoing personalities with very strong drives as he likes to be challenged constantly.","I believe Andres would be a wonderful SSM as he is everything I think an SSM should be: a mentor, a friend, a leader, and someone who is always there.

First, Angel has an advanced understanding of the resources and organizations on campus. She is extremely involved and is part of Freshman Council, the African American Student Union, and SGA. She spends her extracurricular time serving Tech students in these leadership roles, and her extensive knowledge of campus will allow her to effectively connect residents to organizations they are interested in and resources that they can utilize.  In addition to her knowledge of the Georgia Tech community, Angel is also extremely approachable and kind. I find it very easy to talk to Angel because it is clear she genuinely cares about her peers. Other members of Angel’s staff would find it easy and enjoyable to work with her because she has charisma and has experience working with others on projects and in organizations.","Because Angel is so involved on campus, she does not spend long periods of time in the residence hall at a time. However, the time she spends is meaningful because she interacts with other residents in the hall, takes the time to talk to me about her day, attends hall programs, and is not afraid to ask me questions. Angel would need to work on being available and accessible to residents, but I think her wonderful time management skills and genuine passion will help her make her role as an SSM a priority.","I believe that Angel could work with first-year students or with upperclassmen, but she would be more successful working with first-year students. Angel is extremely knowledgeable about Freshman Leadership Organizations and other leadership opportunities for first-year students on campus, and she would help her residents adapt to college life.  Angel can work with a wide variety of personality types. She is confident and likes to take action so she would balance well with idea-oriented individuals. Soft-spoken individuals may find it difficult to work with Angel at first, but they would quickly realize that Angel is a very genuine, caring person and would eventually find it easy to open up to her.","Angel would be an extremely successful SSM on any staff.

I have worked as her Sophmore Advisor specializing in Internal Relations and Individual Student Growth. I have gotten to know Annika very well and have learned a lot about her leadership style and passions.,"Annika is one of the most caring people I have ever met. She is incredible at conflict resolution simply because she genuinely wants the best for every party involved. Her organization skills are impeccable, and she has the perfect balance of fun and professionalism.  ","When I first met Annika, she had little confidence in her own ideas. It's been incredible to see how just a few months in a leadership position among her peers has forced Annika to grow and know when her ideas need to be heard. I feel like being a SSM would continue to help Annika grow even further in this area, which would be amazing because she has some of the best ideas when it comes to event-planning.","Annika is typically called 'Mom' amongst her peers simply because she has the same nurturing personality you would expect from a parent. I feel this is a great example of why she would be best at working with first-years. She would be the guidance many first-year students need in this time of their lives. Annika has one of those personality types where she can work with nearly anyone. The possible issue I could see is if someone was constantly mean for no reason, but I feel she of all people would be able to find a resolution to that.","I give Annika my highest recommendation for SSM. She is incredible. She's someone who is going to have such a positive influence on campus and work so hard to create a positive, loving atmosphere that we so badly need at Tech. She makes me want to be a better person, and that's the best kind of leader there is.",N A,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,N A

I have seen her interact not only with those on our hall, but also with those on other floors and other communities. She is a natural leader who is caring and truly looks to find the best in people. She would make an excellent PL for a multitude of reasons but especially because she truly cares for those around her. She seeks to make sure everyone feels included and strives to help everyone find their own successes. She truly pushes those she spends time with - including myself - to be a better person and to have confidence in who they are.","I think Annika's biggest weakness is that she is on the quiet side. However, she overcomes this in that she is not shy. She is always willing to step up to the plate and be a leader. Her quietness is usually just more so because she is listening and paying attention to what is going on around her. ","I truly believe that Annika could work well with anyone on this campus. However, I think she would be best paired with first-years. I think she would be least compatible with the students in I-House but could still prove successful there.","Annika would (and hopefully will) make an incredible PL. She is amazing in all that she does but mostly in the way that she cares for those around her. She seeks out other people's strengths and uses those to make them more successful. She is great at time management, extremely driven, and also, involved on campus and would be able to guide other first-years in finding their own place at GT. Lastly, she is an out of state student which will enable her to relate to students who are nervous or home-sick while at Georgia Tech. All in all, Annika is absolutely deserving of this position and truly would excel at this position.",Annika is one of the most qualified people to be a PL. It would be a loss to our housing communities to not have her on staff.,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Yes,"None, other than you should hire her!

Her calm demeanor makes her approachable and a calm steady force should a crisis arise.,"Because of all of the things I've mentioned, I know Antra will likely be on fo the best SSMs you've encountered.  She is intelligent, eager to learn and help others, and a warm, loving person who will embrace the students she is responsible for.  They will find her an outstanding listener as well!",I am very happy to recommend Antra to you.  She is simply an exceptional young woman.,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,I have no concerns whatsoever about Antra.  She is one of the most exceptional students I have taught in 23 years.
12 15 2015  3:52:00 PM,Antra Das,Soham (Ronak) Mukhopadhyay,Peer Leader,soham6@gatech.edu,RA PL Recommendation,Other (please specify in next question),Close Friend,5 years,"Antra is incredibly observant, perceptive, and caring. All of these traits are invaluable to the position, as she can identify residents that are having a tough time and will be willing to do her best in order to help them. Additionally, she is very involved on campus, such that she can help her residents find their niche on campus. Antra has worked in similar roles in the past, at Kumon, where she integrated students into a small learning community and tutored them in areas that they struggled in.  Furthermore, Antra is very easy to talk to, with a broad set of interests. This allows her to establish common ground with many individuals, which is a very underestimated skill in building relationships. She is also very easygoing and loyal, which makes her easy to like and encourages people in getting to know her.  As a member of staff, Antra is experiencing in working in a team setting as both a leader and organizer. Her numerous roles on campus and throughout her life have given her the necessary experience in organizing and leading events. She is an active member in the clubs and organizations that interest her (AMSA, Red Cross) and has received honors that distinguish her for going above and beyond what the casual member contributes.  Also, Antra is very active in many communities, such as her own floor, her friend group, and her sorority. She is culturally diverse, and very tolerant of different cultures and beliefs. She has a strong support network that she put much effort into building, and she recognizes the importance of community in oneâ€™s life, particularly in new students coming from all walks of life.  ","Antra could make the most of the student staff member role as her already impressive communication, leadership, and organization skills would be exercised further. She actively seeks out more responsibility, as indicated by her resume, for example, in her positions as student body president and orchestra leadership council in high school, and her position and the MOVE Medical Committee Chief Event Officer. Constant interactions with residents absolutely would give her practice in building, maintaining, and mending relationships. Importantly, Antra desires to make a difference with her life as a doctor, also serving in the Peace Corps. Doctors must build relationships with patients as quickly as possible in order to put them at ease; the position as a student staff member would definitely prime her for this role in the feature, as emergencies and bumps in relationships occur. Antra has much to contribute and much to benefit in her own development as a student staff member. ","I have no doubt that Antra would work extremely well with any type of resident as a result of her broad involvement in various activities throughout her life. As she is very mature for her age, I would trust her understanding the attitudes of older residents and could see her working very well with older students as a Residential Advisor.  However, due to her involvement on campus and friendly, easygoing, but perceptive personality, Antra would make an excellent Peer Leader for first- year students. She would serve as an excellent resource and help residents get accustomed and involved in their floor community, and around campus in order to find organizations and clubs that they would be interested in. Her qualities that would make her a great Peer Leader are discussed in the first question.  Due to her active listening skills, Antra works well with all personalities as she can both contribute to a conversation and focus as an active listener. I feel that she works better with slightly more open and enthusiastic personalities that are common among first years, rather than the slightly more reserved attitudes that upperclass students often possess.  ","Undoubtedly, Antra has all the qualities to make an excellent SSM. But most importantly, Antra has the desire to help others and make a difference in othersâ€™ lives. From her involvement, this is apparent because of her contributions in service clubs and events such as blood drives. This attitude of giving back is fundamental and a prerequisite to being a good Student Staff Member, and few possess this quality as strongly as Antra does. ",Antra has a very interesting blend of introverted  extroverted qualities that allow her to connect and have strong relationships with people with a diverse set of personalities. ,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,"Antra is very cultured, as she grew up with a  different cultural background and is active in it (dance, language, etc).

She is easy to get along with; incredibly intelligent and speaks eloquently, but still very relatable; and is always willing to step up and help when needed.

","Aradhana is friendly around the hall and generally approachable. There were two issues in her quad this semester, both of which she handled very well through good mediation skills. The first issue was a cleanliness issue caused by one of the roommates. She discussed it with the roommate directly while during the meeting where we created a roommate contract, which takes a lot of courage. The other issue was that one of the roommates was struggling with school and showing symptoms of depression. She and one of her roommates approached me privately about the issue to voice their concern. I can imagine her practicing the same awareness and compassion for her future residents. ","Aradhana became far more engaging and communicative with other residents in the hall as the semester went on, but she was shy at the beginning. This tendency may lead her to have a difficult time in the beginning of the year when everyone is new. She may do better in this position than I think because she would be one of the oldest in the hall, but my initial observations show that she may need some tips on how to intentionally engage and become comfortable with her residents the first few weeks of school.","Aradhana is liked by all of her roommates (who each have very different personalities) and I frequently see her with people from inside and outside the hall, so I imagine she could work well with any personality. Given the way she treats me--which is very respectfully, sometimes 'overly' respectfully--I don't think she would be totally comfortable approaching residents older than her about conflicts. She would probably feel most comfortable with first-year students.","Yes. Aradhana has been very responsible, kind, and engaging in the hall. She is easily the biggest 'mediator' of her quad where each of her roommates has very different personalities. Tolerance and mediation are second nature for her, and this would be really good for being an SSM. ","While I can vouch for her enthusiasm and ability to work with people on an individual basis, I do not know how she would be on teams (i.e. working with her co-SSMs). She is definitely worth interviewing, and that is something I would ask about! ",Good,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Average,Good,Good,Average,Good,"Yes, but with reservations","The only part I cannot speak to regarding Aradhana's qualifications is her ability to work collaboratively with others, support her colleagues, etc. This is something I would ask about in the interview to gauge how well she would be able to work with a Co-RA PL!

He was a student in my IB chemistry classes from 10th through 12th grade. I also supervised Arber's extended essay research in chemistry for the IB programme.,"Arber is naturally meticulous and detail-oriented, and he has experience in organizing and coordinating events due to his management of math tutoring during high school. Arber was also my â€œgo-toâ€ student; if I ever needed feedback on a lesson or insight into how to my students were handling the material, I knew I could rely on Arber for honest, helpful responses. He has a calm, gracious demeanor that puts people at ease; his fellow students could depend on him for advice as well. Arber is academically gifted, but also quick-witted and very funny. ","Arber's calmness may initially be mistaken for shyness, but this is not the case. He takes his time observing people, not speaking at first, because he is trying to understand the person before engaging in a conversation. Once he has a good understanding, he is a warm, thoughtful, and entertaining person. ","Arber would work well with all levels, but would probably work best with first-years, seeing that he is completing his first year currently. That experience will be fresh in his mind, so he will be able to speak to it with a fresh, positive energy. I have observed Arber working with a large variety of personalities in class and during tutoring, and his diplomatic nature is unwavering. He handles difficult personalities better than some teachers! ","Absolutely. Arber enjoys helping others and creating a positive atmosphere for his peers. He is not the over-the-top-aggressive-leader type, but more of a leader-by-example. He was well-respected and liked by classmates and staff during high school, even after four years together.

He has shown great incentive to bring happiness to many people in our hall, earning himself a lot of respect from his peers. He is very inclusive when it comes to making friends and I have noticed how Arber has genuinely brought together people who were shy in the beginning. In my frequent personal interactions with him, I have picked up on how seriously he takes his academics and the strategies he uses to manage his time. No matter what the situation, to this date I have not noticed Arber get flustered at himself or anyone else. He handles situations with a sense of ease and calmness that is rare to find in today's day. He displays a confidence when interacting with everyone and is very well aware of people's sensitivities. With all this, he also has a lot of fun with people, is very witty and makes a lot of good puns that would keep staff and residents laughing!",The only potential areas of development I see for Arber would be learning specific ways of dealing with situations which would be covered during training and BCD's.,"I believe this candidate would be great for all types of people, but I would recommend him to work with First-years. I feel that first-years would learn a lot from him since his interpersonal skills would be of great value to first-years who are seeking to get connected to the community.","I absolutely feel Arber would make a great SSM. A lot of my reasoning is based on the positivity he has brought to our floor and our community in Smith. He has a great sense of how to create an appropriate balance between work and play, that would make him excel at this job.",,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,I would like to take this last opportunity to recommend him to all the Hall Directors out there.

I have witnessed many occasions in which Ashok has invited other residents to go eat, study, or workout together.  Outside of the residence hall, I know that Ashok participates in multiple clubs and organizations (i.e. the swim team), which I see as an indication of his willingness to become involved across a wider spectrum in the community.","I think that Ashok definitely needs to attain a better grasp on the concept of active listening.  His tendencies to be socially outgoing will occasionally backfire, dejecting the individuals he is talking to.   This could potentially be turned around, and there is no doubt in my mind that further refinement in this area would develop the candidate into a model SSM.","Ashok is definitely cut out to work with first-years.  He would be a perfect fit for the Freshman Experience, and I am confident that Ashok would be able to successfully lead his residents in an enthusiastic and enriching manner.  The candidate is largely compatible with other socially gregarious individuals, which serves as the basis for my Freshman Experience recommendation.

I have full confidence that he will go above and beyond to complete what is asked of him and will not hesitate to ask for help from his peers is necessary. ","As a potential SSM, not having more than  a year's experience on campus would make it a bit difficult to acclimate to the SSM position while still figuring out academic vs. job balance. In addition to that, without much time under his belt, it would be a bit difficult to be a thorough resource for residents with necessary, however, if need be, I am positive he would be quick to learn the necessary info for the position.

As I have worked with him, I have learned about his many qualities that would make him an ideal SSM. BenjamÃ­n has a great set of ethical standards. Despite his soft-spoken demeanor, I have witnessed times when he has challenged someone on their ethically dubious viewpoint. He is capable of holding intense 1-on-1 conversations by asking deep, insightful questions and truly listening to the responses.

This means that he can always identify the appropriate campus resource for nearly any problem! He would truly be an asset to any SSM team.","One of BenjamÃ­n's strengths is also his biggest weakness.

I am currently the RHA Executive Board liaison for her Hall Council, and I act as a bridge between her and her fellow officers and big RHA.","Friendly, charismatic, and approachable are the three adjectives that come to mind when thinking about Brittany. Having worked with her for a semester, I have seen her attract people to her hall council meetings with ease. Residents who attend meetings regularly (and there are a fair number of them, especially for an upperclassman hall council) come back because they feel that she is giving them relevant information, she is entertaining, and she encourages community building among the people in her hall council. From her Spongebob meme-inspired emails to her charismatic personality during meetings, she engages residents in a way I rarely see in people holding her same position in other hall councils. She has organized social events for hall councils before, and she is very knowledgeable in various resources around campus, and so I believe she will be very capable of being a resource to her floor as a SSM. ","She is a very others-oriented person; as such, she tends to put other people before herself. There are times when this is a good trait, especially being an SSM with lots of residents. However, there are other times when she has to prioritize herself and learning when to do so is one major area of development for her.","Although I believe she would be successful with any type of residents, I think sheâ€™d work best with upperclass students. She lets other people approach her when they need help, and she presents herself such that people are comfortable doing so. She recognizes peopleâ€™s need for someone to take the first step, but she does not overwhelm you with options. She has the balance of initiating and waiting for people to make the first move, something upperclass students highly appreciate.","I believe Brittany would make a great SSM. Her personality lends itself to being around people and making them feel welcome, which is a great trait for an SSM who wants her residents to feel at home here at Tech. She is also incredibly selfless, always putting other peopleâ€™s needs before her own. Sheâ€™s willing to go above and beyond as long as her residents are happy, even at the cost of her own time or energy. She also has experience being a bridge between a resource and residents, as that is a big part of her work as a hall council officer for RHA. She makes sure residents are aware of where their money is going and what resources are available to them. In short, she has all the makings of a good SSM.","She has a lot of friends who are SSMs; as such, she has a really solid understanding of what it takes to be a good SSM and what the job looks like.",Good,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Yes,"She's worked really well with her residents, with the RAs in her building, with her Hall Director and with the RHA Executive Board, and I see no reason why she wouldn't work really well with her residents and fellow SSMs next year."

Even as a high school student, Brooke was wise beyond her years and easy to get along with. She is perceptive and can gauge the needs of those around her--a great quality to have as an SSM. ","I can honestly say I do not know of any areas of development for Brooke. She is kind, engaging, and thoughtful. She is gentle, and would therefore relate to all types of residents, from shy, reserved students to outgoing ones.     ","While Brooke would be extraordinary with residents of all ages, she would truly excel with first years. Because of Brooke’s compassion and approachability, she would make so many freshmen women feel more comfortable while adjusting to college. Brooke would work well in the role of a peer leader, for she would be a wonderful resource for freshmen to reach out to whenever they have questions about all the changes that come with college. "," Brooke came to me earlier this year with the idea of hosting a music night for the hall. She offered to host and play guitar for all those in attendance. Brooke goes above and beyond her role as a resident, She has built residents with many other students on the hall. I can guarantee that the same would be true for her in the role of an SSM.

She is incredibly outgoing to everyone in the hall and she is so welcoming. She is very driven (which really shows in her running for hall council at the same time that she was pledging a sorority and getting involved in many other things on campus) and she is very centered on how she can help people and how she can do more to better herself. Another strength she has is her incredible interpersonal skills. She not only knows how to start a conversation with people, she knows how to instantly go deeper and how to get to the core of how someone is feeling. This is a beautiful strength that would truly help her to excel in the Peer Leader position. She is also very creative and open-minded which would help her with planning events (because she was social chair for hall council). ","I cannot think of any specific areas of improvement for Candice that apply to the SSM position, however, I have noticed that she can occasionally lack confidence. She definitely has enough confidence to make an incredible Peer Leader however she does not always realize how great of a job she is doing. I do not think this will affect her abilities negatively as a peer leader but I believe receiving the position in general will give her that confidence boost she needs to truly excel. ","I believe Candice would be an incredible resource for the first-years specifically, because she will be only a second-year when she starts, so she will easily be able to relate to them. She has made such an inspiring effort this past semester to find herself, get involved, remain balanced, and have a diverse friend group, and I just feel as though she can make such an amazing and valuable impact on any first year she has the opportunity to lead. She has grown so much this year and I am incredibly proud of all that she has done. I believe any first-year would feel 100% comfortable to approach her and I believe she would feel much more confident and comfortable to help first-years than she would for upperclassmen. Nevertheless, I am positive she would be a great candidate for RA as well. ","As I previously stated in my other responses, I think Candice is an incredible candidate for the Peer Leader position. I can confidently say that I would have been blessed to have her as a PL when I was a first year. I think that not only can she give so much to this position, but I believe she is someone that would be able to get so much out of it as well. I have full faith in her ability to whole-heartedly lead and guide anyone that she is able to be a peer leader for and any staff would be beyond lucky to have her. On top of her valuable ability to lead and inspire, she is able to connect with pretty much anyone she comes in contact with and I am sure that she will make a strong effort to become close with her hall director and staff as well. ","If she is accepted to the Peer Leader position, I would love to have her on my staff :D   (Yes I know I probably don't get a choice in this, but I thought I would say it anyway) ",Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Yes,She's wonderful.

He is a good listener and skilled at keeping up conversation, all adding up to an individual with a knack for building relationships. Carl has a contagious vision for our hall this year, the kind of 'contagious' that gets the most hesitant resident to come to hall council or the resident too cool for a hall event to attend. Carl also has the initiative to plan events and fulfil his responsibilities without being told. He has taken a strong interest in our community and building it this year, so given the opportunity I have no doubt he will be very effective when given residents of his own. Carl is also no stranger to diversity. He has made a point to befriend some of the most diverse residents on the hall and does a great job interacting with them.","I haven't seen Carl use many of the campus resources such as counseling or tutoring, so I think he would need training in where to refer students in what situations. Carl is also not extremely involved on campus, so while he will have ample time for his residents, I fear he won't have a lot to offer with respect to finding and joining student organizations.","I think Carl would have the easiest time connecting with first-year students. Carl looks for mentorship frequently and I can see him willing to give it to new students. I think Carl would take full advantage of any freshman who are even somewhat social, using whatever time he has with them to get them to buy into the hall's community. I have never seen Carl have issues working with any personality type, but I would expect he would most likely run into issues with a strong regal or 'too cool' personality type. For example, he might not be able to sway residents very stubbornly avoiding hall programming, as he might be too passive to get them to come.","Carl was one of the first of my residents to go out of his way to build relationships with residents throughout the hall. He regularly attends hall events and will be leading his own this spring. Carl is always agreeable and friendly with an aptitude for connecting with all different types of people. I can see Carl as a great leader for a hall, enthusiastic about building a strong community and serious about his responsibilities as a university employee.",,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Good,Yes,N A

I have served as my Chapter's Philanthropy Chair and the Colligate Panhellenic Council's Philanthropy Chair over the past two years. As a sister in my sorority, we have served on committees together. I have seen Caroline excel in these committees serving as a creative resource for these committees responsibilities. ","Caroline's strengths in communication, leadership, integrity and approachability would make Caroline an exceptional SSM. Caroline would make an excellent counselor to residents and would maintain the strong integrity that is needed in such a position.  Caroline has a very strong heart. She is extremely approachable and as emerged as a strong leader through the time I have known her. She has been involved in service before her time at Georgia Tech, but through her time here Caroline has been involved in Alternative Spring Break, Circle of Sisterhood and Autism Speaks. Through her involvement in these service organizations she has further learned the process of planning events and the organizational skills needed for the SSM role.","Many first year students have not been given the chance to really get involved that many organizations by the end of their first semester. Caroline is no exception. She has taken this first semester as most first year students in my opinion should to really focus on getting acclimated to the Georgia Tech environment and classes. Caroline has maintained a high GPA of a 3.5 in her first semester at Georgia Tech and is now looking to get involved more deeply in our community. She has expressed deep interest in the role as a Student Staff Member and I firmly believe that she would be an excellent candidate for any staff. As most first years students Caroline will need to develop in her knowledge of resources on campus to further help her residents; however, I know she can easily learn this during SSSM training in the Fall and through her fellow SSMs as a resource.","Caroline would be perfect for working with mostly first year students.  I have seen Caroline work with several different personalities through my time knowing her and I can honestly say that she has the ability to work well with a large variety of personalities due to her strong interpersonal skills.  I believe that she works exceptionally well, however, with energetic, strong personalities. I believe that she could really bloom and reach her full potential through a large PL staff. I believe that a quiet, reserved personalities would not allow Caroline to reach her full potential. ","As a Residential Advisor for the past 3 years, I have been given the opportunity to work with several different types of staff members.I have seen the staff members that are able to easy connect with residents and I believe that Caroline will be one of these staff members. While being able to connect with residents is crucial, some staff members find it very difficult to balance school work with being a staff member. I firmly believe that Caroline will be able to be a strong staff member balancing school and her job. She also has the creative ability  to reach a diverse group of residents and the leadership skills to excel in maintaining the respect of student in her area. Caroline has a very strong integrity and I firmly believe that if placed in a difficult situation Caroline would follow SSM protocol and maintain the integrity of the job. I believe without hesitation that Caroline would make an excellent Student Staff Member to any staff.

She's sung in multiple choirs and has been an invaluable officer. Additionally, I assist in her vocal lessons and she just enrolled in an academic class that I teach. ","Catherine is one of the most enthusiastic, honest, and passionate students I've ever worked with. As an officer of the choirs, she's responsible for the logistics of the ensemble. She deals with a variety of student issues in this capacity, as well as logistical problems that she must solve. She is pragmatic yet creative in solving these problems. Additionally, she is self motivated--for example she took it on herself to research, acquire money, and purchase new dresses for the choirs. This was no small undertaking as the school had no budget and we had no support for new dresses. She applied for funding and received it and several months after the initial thought, we have new dresses. She is well connected with the rest of campus and would make a wonderful SSM.","As with any student, Catherine's skill set of dealing with life situations will improve as she gets older. This sounds cliche but it's absolutely true in Catherine's case--she sometimes takes on too many projects. She has well meaning intentions, but learning to delegate or pass up potential projects may help her be more successful in the long run. ",Catherine would probably work best with underclassmen. Her knowledge of campus and the groups on campus would probably best serve those who have just arrived on campus and learning to deal with the rigors and challenges of college. She is encouraging and can be a good role model for someone who may be overwhelmed in the first several semester of college. ,"Catherine’s role as a student officer and leader in the Georgia Tech Chamber Choir is superb. As one of the directors of this choir, I work with her on group and individual projects in order for the choirs to run more smoothly. Catherine initiates ideas, completes projects, and communicates to others like a professional. I can always count on her for the smallest and biggest tasks. For example, this spring, Catherine approached me with the idea of replacing 100 choir dresses for the entire choral program. Knowing the limitations of the choral budget, the lack of success in outside funding and support, and the resistance to change amongst the other choral officers, I informed Catherine of her odds but told her to pursue it if she wanted. Several weeks later, Catherine secured funding from several sources for about 90% of the dresses and lobbied the other officers to approve the project. A few weeks ago, the new dresses were ordered and arrived on campus. This is a perfect example of Catherine’s self-motivation, selfless passion, communication skills, and follow-through. Other smaller projects include organizing concerts for small groups, organizing advertising for concerts, arranging transportation for singers, amongst many other tasks. These choral projects, large and small, are entirely selfless and entirely for the success, health, and community building of the choirs.   Catherine is a selfless leader who takes initiative, is the utmost professional, and thinks analytically and pragmatically. She would be a great asset to you—her flexibility and adventurous spirit would serve well in any environment she would be placed. It is for all these above stated reasons that I fully recommend Catherine Stephens for a SSM position.","I also know Catherine’s academic studies through her pursuit of a minor in music. I accompany her lessons and play for her vocal final juries exams. Part of her minor is completing academic coursework and I have worked closely with her with music theory, history, and technology. She is well prepared in her lessons—clearly having practiced and learned her music. She has gone beyond the typical student in music analysis—I often will peek at her choral music and see that she has notated large portions of the music with both harmonic and formal analysis. These analysis exercises are not a portion of the class; however, she is so curious that she voluntarily studies more music than is assigned. These analyses are often tricky, and require critical thinking and interpretation. Catherine’s problem solving skills are clearly well sharpened.

Her outstanding ability to organize and execute large events (full concerts) and to manage a choir of 40 will easily spill over into her role as a student staff member.","Catherine occasionally takes on too many responsibilities, when she could delegate them to others.

I have know her since August 2015.,"Chermia's greatest strengths are her cheerful disposition, leadership qualities (she has a very high degree of initiative and motivation), her integrity, and willingness and desire to go above and beyond what is required. ","Chermia is a very well-rounded, thoughtful individual. She quickly adapted  to life at Georgia Tech as an incoming Freshman and  seemed to balance school and social life well. She attended 100% of my classes and completed all work on time. I cannot think of any areas of development other than gaining more college experience as she spends more time at Tech! I believe that she would be an excellent resource to other students as her communication and social skills are outstanding.","While I believe that Chermia would be successful working with most any type of residents (in class, she interacted easily with both students her own age as well as our upper-class team leaders), I believe that she would really excel working with younger, first-year students. She is out-going and warm and would make incoming students feel at ease. She worked well with all types of differing personalities and received high praise from her group project teammates on her peer evaluations.","Without a doubt, I believe that Chermia would make an excellent SSM and recommend her without hesitation. In class, she continually impressed me with her ability to interact well with other students, TLs, and guest speakers. She was a leader in group activities and it was apparent that other students respected and valued her participation and opinions. She always demonstrated cultural competence working well with a diverse group of students.

",Chermia is  self-motivated and a natural leader. She has a quiet self-confidence about her that  puts others at ease and makes them feel comfortable around her.

The SSM role is time consuming, and can be difficult to juggle with one’s academic and personal goals. Chhaya’s impressive resume is especially noteworthy as she juggles multiple executive and technical roles and intensive courses while commuting to campus every day. She connects well to people, and I have worked with her on countless group projects and assignments through which I have been impressed by her ability to include all members of the group in the conversation, and make them feel valued. She has the seldom seen ability to make group interactions seem like a personal conversation along with a group activity, seamlessly. She has experience in many roles that require her to organize events, which translates well to organizing creative events for her community and the area. Her ability in group settings makes her an ideal fit on every staff on campus, and her infectious enthusiasm would encourage turnout and community building on her floor, building, and community. ","I believe Chhaya’s skillset is well tailored to serving as an SSM, and experience in the role will only improve her excellent communication, organization, and interaction skills. Her extensive experience in organizing events will serve her well in hosting and planning events for her area, and having the opportunity to do so through the role will develop this capacity further. She draws others into conversations and explores their passion in conversation, and training in reflective questioning and active listening would magnify this asset greatly. ","The candidate would be successful with both first-years and upperclass residents. The strengths listed above allow her to fit the needs of both populations. Both first years and upperclassmen would benefit from her extensive experience with campus involvement, advice regarding time management, and opportunities in organizations and classwork.  Chhaya’s enthusiasm would allow her to reach out to the most introverted and difficult residents, as her attitude would ensure that she would not give up in an attempt to incorporate said individual into the community. She would always be willing to interact with her residents and help them when needed. She works best with people with similar personalities as her, as she could incorporate their ideas in programs and events that appealed to everyone involved, rather than trying to come up with the best fit by herself. However, her diverse interests and her understanding of her residents’ personalities would allow her to reach out to all of her residents.  ","I believe Chhaya would make an extremely successful SSM, particularly as a first year. She would be easy to reach out to and her friendly persona and infectious enthusiasm would enable her to create a fast, well- knit network that her residents would be able to fit into seamlessly. After the initial adapting to college life, her experience with campus involvement, time management skills, and academic strengths would allow her to give valuable advice and would serve as an excellent role model for her residents. On staff, her experience with group work would allow her to fit in and contribute without feeling uncomfortable, and within a few months she would become an incredible asset when it comes to administrative duties and event  program preparation.

I have known Chicka for about 4 years.,"Chika is a leader and participated in Cobb County's leadership program.  She is well respected among her peers as well as adults.  She is courageous as well as resilient and most of all just a great person.  Those who know her LOVE her and those who don't, want to know her.  She has a contagious smile and is just fun to be around.  She is a great friend as well.  She is a very hard worker who in HS had to manage a job, school and varsity tennis.","Honestly, I haven't seen any weaknesses.  She is a hard charger, so maybe learning to slow down and get more sleep!?  She works very hard at all that she does so perhaps could work on incorporating more down time into her routine.","Chika would be someone who could interact and be successful with a lot of different type individuals.  I got to see Chika interact in our small group at church which consisted of 30 different girls, from different schools and backgrounds.  She is a good listener and often times, girls would share their problems, situations, and Chika relates well.  Chika experienced the death of her father at the beginning of her senior year so would also be able to relate to any students going through a tough situation that might occur while at school.","I have known Chika throughout high school and into now her freshman year of college and watched her grow from a teenage girl into a mature young woman.  I’ve observed her in a full palette of human interactions.  She has served in a number of organizations in our community, school and church, but in particular her work within our small group at church.  While as a small group leader, I’ve spent time with countless impressive young people.  Like Chika, they are smart, hardworking, good students, and polite.  But what sets apart Chika is her heart.  Our small group consists of girls from different high schools, different interests and different degrees of faith.  Having her in our group, I am privileged to see her closely interact with the other girls in our group.  She truly is an asset and so great at listening, learning and sharing.  Chika gets along well with others whether it is with adults, her peers, and family. Most notable, has been the last year of Chika’s life.  Into her senior year, her father, who was her mentor, encourager and biggest cheerleader, passed suddenly.  Throughout the year, we stood by her, holding her up and just being there for her.  I cannot tell you how strong, vulnerable and resilient she was during this time.  She continued to fight on supporting her family, completing her magnet school program, participating on the Varsity tennis team, all while finalizing college plans and in the midst of grieving.  Never have I witnessed a more resilient and strong young woman.  I believe this hardship has prepared Chika for just about anything and given her more appreciation for life in general but also for overcoming hardships that come our way.        As Chika and our small group girls have developed and grown, it has been amazing to see them lead and mentor each other.  Others are drawn to her because she has such a warm personality and people are just comfortable around her.  Chika leads by example in every part of her life and has been a role model to many students and her peers and her family as well.  She has flourished in high school and has a heart for helping others. At a time when most teenagers are getting into all sorts of things, she has poured herself into being a strong part of her community and serving others at time when many teens would suffer.  You could not make a better choice for this scholarship!  You will receive in return a dedicated college student who will be an asset to any program she participates in.  I would be happy to talk to you about Chika in more detail.  Please feel free to give me a call at 770-241-6968.

Chris has an intimate knowledge of Hall Council and RHA, and is always looking for ways to get involved in the Glenn community. He has become close friends with numerous residents on his floor, as well as on my floor and throughout Glenn. I think these people skills, as well as knowledge about residence-life governing bodies like Hall Council and RHA, are essential to the SSM position.","Chris is committed to finding out why and how thinks work the way they do. He is not afraid of getting to the bottom of a messy situation, and proposing a better and more efficient way of doing things. As a SSM, Chris would be able to develop his conflict-resolution skills so that he can get to the truth of the matter in the most sensitive, unassuming, way possible. This is a difficult skill-set to master, but I believe that with a little practice Chris can really excel in this area.","I think Chris's caring, can-do, down-to-earth, personality would work well in almost any setting. I can see him working with first-years as a PL, because he has excellent know-how when it comes to getting things done in Hall Council, as well as resolving difficult roommate situations. However, Chris's exceptional maturity would also make him suited for a role working with upperclassmen. ","I believe Chris would make an outstanding SSM because he is mature and responsible, yet attentive and concerned for those around him. Chris is responsible enough to take the SSM job seriously, but he is also a 'people person' that loves to get involved in the Glenn community. Not only has Chris attended each and every Hall Council session this semester, but he has also passed at least 3 HC bills to enrich the community. One of my favorite was a debate night, where he hosted a Democratic Debate Watch party with pizza and drinks. The event had a huge turnout and got everyone talking about the upcoming election. Chris is also invested in making sure Hall Council procedure is followed as closely as possible. Chris has also started a GNNN (Glenn Nightly News Network) Youtube channel, along with a few other Glenn residents, specifically to report the latest news from our hall. The channel is now very popular and keeps everyone up-to-date with the latest events going on in Glenn, in a humorous light. The social media and communication skills Chris has demonstrated through this project are truly exemplary. Overall, it is clear that Chris has the know-how and the drive to make our residence hall a better place, and I am confident that he will be able to do that for future resident halls to come.",I would just like to share that Chris has helped me grow as an SSM throughout this semester through his unique perspective and commitment to improving the Glenn community.,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Average,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,"No,"

She has even held leadership positions in some of these activities including Student Government, National Honor Society, and Friends Club.",Areas of development for Ciandra as a potential SSM are becoming a 'resource' to her peers and becoming knowledgeable about the services offered by Georgia Tech.,"Ciandra would be able to work with any type of resident because of her warm, friendly and approachable personality. If I had to, I would choose 'mostly first-years' considering she is experiencing her first year at Georgia Tech.

I worked with Cici from the end of May 2015 through most of August 2015.  I was responsible for directing and mentoring Cici and other Electrical Engineering interns on various technical tasks.  Cici excelled on all her tasks and put forth extra effort to learn all she could.  She is a very dedicated individual and I am sure she would do well as a Resident Advisor.,"Cici has a positive 'can do' attitude and she applies herself fully into any task assigned to her.  When working with her, I found her to consistently look for the simplest and best (not always the simplest) way of performing a particular task - she was not afraid of experimenting to identify the best approach.  And, she is very much open to constructive feedback; she takes it seriously and acts on it.","Experience with the subject matter.  Cici had little experience with many technical tasks we initially assigned to her.  However, she really applied herself and picked up the necessary skills faster than most interns we've had.  I am sure, if given the chance, Cici will quickly develop any required skill set needed of an SSM.","I expect Cici's positive attitude would work well with residents of all backgrounds.  Cici tends to work best with personalities similar to hers.  However, she is able to flex and make accommodations in her own personality to help interact with those who are different from her.","Yes - Cici is very much dedicated to any task assigned to her.

She is loved by all of her peers and can get along with anyone.  She is the only girls on my floor that has taken the time to get to know everyone.  She is genuine and personable.  What really makes Claire stand out is that she pairs her winning personality with hard work.  If you give her a task, she will get it done, and complete it beyond your expectations.  ","At first Claire seems somewhat quiet and shy.  Once you interact with her a couple of times, you then learn that she is quirky, funny, and very kind. I think this position will provide her with a great learning opportunity for being able to open up to people sooner and really find her voice from the get-go.","I could honestly see Claire in either of these settings.  She is patient, kind, and relatable, which is the type of personality that could do well in any of these environments.  If I had to pick, I'd say she would be most successful with first-years.  Her creativity and event planning skills (from helping out hall council to SCPC), would make for some really awesome programs for the first- years.  ","Yes, Claire would make a fantastic SSM.  To me, some of the most important qualities for an SSM to have are passion for the position, a love of people, a relatable personality, and the desire to grow as a leader.  I've witnesses all of the qualities in Claire, and could really see her  going above the call of duty to positively impact the lives of other students on campus through this position. ","Claire is great.  I think she would be a really great fit anywhere!  She would be a great asset to any staff.

She is applying for an SSM as a freshman, and she will have recently gone through what they did. She works particularly well with other outgoing personalities. I feel that she might struggle a bit with more reserved individuals.","I believe that Claire would be a great SSM.

Her organization also contributes to her effectiveness, especially in the role of a Hall Council officer. Her organization skills prevent over-scheduling and miscommunication. She is better able to help not only herself succeed, but others. ","Connie tends to be shy. She prefers to stay in her comfort zone and normal routine. As a potential SSM, Connie will need to learn how to come out of her shell more and take the initiative to start conversations and activities. Residents will look to her to make the first move and begin to converse. This is often something that she does not do. ","Connie would work best with first-year students. Her desire and want to help those around her and act as a mentor will allow her to succeed mostly with first-years as they will also want someone to look up to.

She and I have met regularly throughout the year in a variety of settings. ,"One of Cori's greatest strengths is her almost natural ability to include everyone. As an intern at CCF, I have watched the community of freshmen students grow and learn. Cori is one of our core leaders, and I feel it is because she befriends all people. She will walk someone home late at night, or invite the new girl to join in. Cori has an eye for community that I think could continue to be developed into a spectacular resource for the GT Housing department. After only a few months, Cori approached me and asked if she could plan an event for the freshmen girls. She noticed a distance between the core students and students that had just begun coming around, and she wanted to create an opportunity for everyone to grow closer.   Cori works incredibly hard at what she does, has never been late to a meeting, is willing to learn and grow, and she works well with others.","I think Cori can continue to grow in developing skills for interpersonal conflict. She has grown in her awareness throughout the past semester of how to handle conflict, and I am confident in her ability to continue to improve.","I think Cori has a very mature personality, and that she would work well with upperclassmen or with first - year students. Seeing as she would be a younger Student Staff member, I could see Cori empathizing well with First year students in the coming year. However, with her maturity, I could see Cori excelling with older students.","Yes! While Cori is young, what makes me most confident in her ability to be a good SSM is how much she has grown in only one semester. I think she could be an incredible investment for GT Housing. She has the perception needed to understand and see needs in a community. She is responsible and hardworking which would be a bonus to any housing staff to hire her.

I have known her since she started at Georgia Tech in the fall of 2015.  ","Courtney’s strength is her desire to grow professionally. Advising her through hall council has been such a joy because after each program and meeting she asks for feedback and how she can improve as a leader. During these sessions Courtney actively listens, take notes, and is eager to learn. This strength will serve her well in all aspects of the SSM position.  ",Courtney will thrive under a supervisor who can help her find balance between the position and her student life. At times I notice Courtney experiencing stress balancing her duties for hall council and student abilities. Her supervisor should work with Courtney to ensure that she does not overcommit so she can enjoy all of her positions on campus.  ,"I envision Courtney thriving with upperclass students. She is a task master and will stay on top of more of the administrative tasks that characterize the RA position. Paired with individuals that are focused and have positive energy, Courtney will find herself on the right team. She’ll also work well with “dreamers”, or those that have ambitious plans and goals for their communities. Courtney may struggle to work with a  more “go with the flow” staff, because she thrives under structure and needs to know what is expected of her.  ","Yes, I give Courtney my highest recommendation. Through her involvement in hall council, Courtney has already been given responsibilities similar to those of an SSM. She has planned both small and large scale programs for our area, and she uses her knowledge of the dynamics of our floor to do so. Courtney took over planning on a sky zone trip for our area when one of the other officers dropped the ball, and she did an excellent job. This program included transportation to and from, purchasing the tickets, collecting money, registering residents, and other logistics. When in doubt, she communicated with me in a timely manner and ultimately delivered an excellent program.

In fact, I do not think I have seen her without a smile on her face.  I believe that her positive attitude would inspire residents, and that she would easily be able to develop strong relationships with her residents and staff.","Although Danyelle's quiet personality makes her very approachable, and would lend itself to meaningful one-on-one interactions with residents,  she would have to learn to bring more energy to hall events and programs.  However I believe that she would be able to learn to be more outgoing when necessary.","I believe that Danyelle would get along with all types of residents, however I believe that her approachability would make her an excellent Peer Leader.  Because Danyelle is more soft-spoken, I believe that she would work best with quieter personalities.","Danyelle's positive attitude and friendly personality make her well-suited for the SSM position.  While talking about her involvement in her high school's yearbook staff, I noticed that she really values collaboration, which I believe is paramount to success as an SSM.

She is very involved in the freshman component of NSBE, Lambda Delta Rho, and is a pleasure to work with.","As a SSM, she would need to develop her time management skills a little more.

She can work with a diverse group of people including different age groups and genders. I think she would work best with upperclassmen rather than freshman.,I definitely believe that Danyelle would make a good SSM because of her natural leadership skills.

She is not overbearing and at she is not always at every single event gathering, but she is always friendly and welcoming to everyone around her. She also has been able to get involved outside of the hall and has proven that she is willing and happy to accept challenges and she continuously pushes herself to achieve more. One example is that she is very active in Hack-GT and in her business fraternity. This determination for bettering herself gives me confidence that as a PL, she will strive to do the best she can. The welcoming attitude just comes naturally to her, so I know this will help her greatly in the PL RA position as well.","She seems to lean towards introversion, which is certainly not a bad thing but it can potentially make it more difficult for her to comfortably plan events with residents. However, I have noticed that she is always doing fun events (hiking in the smokey mountains, having movie nights, ping pong tournaments, etc) with her friends in the other halls so she might be more extroverted than I have realized. I cannot think of any potential areas of development besides this one, and I honestly do not know for sure if this is even an area that she needs to develop. Her introversion makes her incredibly approachable and genuine in her interactions as well, so I have come to really appreciate it. ","I believe Daphne has the capability to work with either first-years or upperclassman, however due to her young age, I believe she would be more compatible comfortable with first-years. She also spoke a lot about believing that freshman year is the most important year in your college career and she would love to guide the first-years in this journey and give them advice that helped her succeed as well. Daphne seems to work very well with the quieter first –years, which tend to be the ones that need the most assistance from their Peer Leaders. However, whenever she ends up in conversation with more extroverted, loud people, she seems to keep up with the conversation well and she always takes interest in what everyone has to say.","I do believe Daphne would make a good PL or RA because of her kind-hearted nature, her dedication to her work, and her genuine reasons for applying. I unfortunately do not see her enough to know fully whether she would be the perfect PL or not, but she is definitely worth considering for the position. She certainly has a great work ethic and care for others. "," I will do my best to get to know this resident better over the next few weeks, so please reach out to me with any more specific questions!",Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Average,Good,Good,Good,"Yes, but with reservations","I only say 'with reservations' because I don't know her well enough yet. But still, from what I can tell, I'm sure she would do a great job. "

Over the semester, I got to know the applicant very well in terms of her personal, professional, and academic aspect and she is now a very good friend of mine.","The applicant is a very hard worker and someone who puts in her best to make a difference in whatever she is doing. She always makes it a point to interact socially and be there for her friends colleagues when they are in need of help during tough times. I vouch for this as I have seen her grow exponentially during her first semester here and become more sincere about these aspects. I find her to be a very comfortable and approachable when I need to talk about serious things. She is also very excited and enthusiastic about whatever she is doing. For example, she planned one of the best fundraisers for a group of 23 peers all alone and this event was a huge success. She has also proven to be a great listener and team mate - during the entirety of this semester she helped every member of AKPsi move forward with their goals while keeping the little things in mind. She inspires those around her to excel in their interests by following her passions wholeheartedly. She is also a great communicator from what I have seen in group work settings. All in all, I think the applicant is a perfect fit for the SSM position because of the diverse set of skills she has shown me in just the span of 4 months. I believe her personality will help her grow in whatever role she takes on.","I believe that the candidate will grow in aspects of handling situations that are beyond her fix as an SSM. This is something she will learn on the job - such as interacting with parents, hall directors and other staff members in these situations to help her succeed in the position. This is something I learnt on the job as well and I see the applicant to pick this up very quickly. I believe the candidate has enough capabilities to build a community around her in a timely manner which I believe to be one of the most important duties of a SSM. Having said that, every experience as a SSM will help her grow personally and professionally. ","This applicant will be most successful with first year students. I have seen this applicant go through a tough first semester exceptionally well and I believe she will be a perfect resource for the incoming class pulling from her own experiences. The applicant has shown me that she can interact with almost anyone around her. Although, she blends well in with people who open upto her and are emotional but at the same time focused and goal oriented. This is definitely something that others around her pick up because of her work ethics. She works least well with people who are not comfortable communicating the needs very bluntly - she appreciates when people are straight forward about things even if it means telling her that she needs to improve upon something. She is always seeking this kind of feedback and thus she might not work well with people who are not comfortable in doing so. ",I believe she is a very good candidate for the SSM position because she has proven to be a pace setter leader in whatever role she has taken. She has very successful in building a tight knit social circle around her and has helped others grow as well. She has the mindset of never leaving any one behind and that is what i appreciate most about her. She is a also a very timely person which i believe is a very important quality.,,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Average,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Yes,I believe that this candidate will be a very great addition to the student staff and those around her will have a great opportunity to learn from her - she will be a very diverse resource and will always take the time out of her own schedule to go that extra step.

Making friends is something he is really good at, and his interpersonal and people skills are unmatched. He is also heavily involved in SHPE (Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers), and owing to his international heritage, understands diversity very well. He takes a keen part in all floor events and always has creative inputs.","Honestly, I have thought hard about David and what his weaknesses (or potential areas of development) as a leader could be, but nothing really comes to my mind. But if I have to say something, I'll say maybe his communication skills. As an international student, English is not his first language and the effects of this can be seen often in his interpersonal conversations. ","Owing to his amiable nature, I think David would fit in both as a PL or as an RA. It boils down to his choice now. ",I think he would make a great SSM.

In my role, I hire, train and supervise all of the PLUS Leaders here at GT.","She is one of the most likable people that I've ever met.  She gets along with everyone and has a fantastic work ethic.  She always completes her logistical duties early, and is always helping out her colleagues whenever possible.  She is very friendly, compassionate, and approachable, but has also been able to set firm boundaries between herself and the students.",Asking for help when needed.  I could see Davira overworking herself instead of reaching out to her supervisors.,"She has worked mostly with incoming freshmen in her sessions, but she also collaborates very well with some of our junior senior PLUS Leaders during trainings and events.  I've observed her working with a student that was very disengaged (on his phone, not paying attention, etc.) and she was able to break out of his shell and join the group.",Absolutely!

She's very approachable and has a very mature mindset that would make her a great SSM. While she's very focused and meticulous in her decisions and actions, she also  has a personality that makes you feel welcomed and respected. ","From what I know, I do not see Tia being very active in the Tech community beyond attending housing events and research. That being said, I could see her development in getting to know Tech more and relaying that knowledge to her residents. ","I believe that Tia would work well with upperclassmen students because she is stronger in that one-on-one bond instead of trying to get freshmen excited about going to school. Because she's more reserved, she would work well with someone who is a bit more outgoing but not overpowering. On the flip side, she would work least well with someone who has no passion whatsoever. ","I believe Tia would be a great SSM. She is very understanding and patient, which I find very critical in SSM's. On the same note, she's very devoted in everything that she does so she would be very determined in enhancing the living learning community for her residents. While she has contributions as an SSM, I know that she could also gain a lot from the position and get to know more different types of people, too. ","Tia is incredibly motivated and in general, probably one of the most successful people I've met at Tech not because her involvement in organizations, grades, or social skills (all qualities that most people think of when they think 'success'), but because of how she knows what she wants and knows how to get what she wants. This in itself is success to me and I know that her residents could definitely benefit from her as a guiding figure.

He has supervised 7 other swim teach coaches, including personal friends. I was amazed at the way he was able to lead peers without conflict. He was clear with his staff of his expectations but was also able to encourage them to have fun when appropriate. It is not common for someone of his age to be such a natural leader and have the ability to balance personal relationships with work expectations. ",Dillon expects perfection from himself and I would anticipate that any situation he was unable to resolve would seem like a personal failure.,"I believe Dillon would be able to work with most any group. I have seen him work with teenagers, young children, same-aged peers, and then be able to turn around and meet with parents. I do not anticipate that there would be any group at Tech that he would have difficulty with. I think he would thrive with freshman simply because i think that he seems to do well in the 'big brother' or 'experienced leader' role. ","Absolutely.

Many residents on the hall consider Elisa someone they can go to for help if needed and someone who is always friendly and smiling. ","Elisa is not aware of all resources available on campus, which is not a surprise considering she is only a freshman. But I believe that after training and education on various resources on campus, she would be a great SSM that could apply those resources to help others when needed. ","I think Elisa would be best suited for working with first-years. She has a calm, friendly, generous personality that many first-years would appreciate since most times they are looking for advice or a friend when they interact with their PLs. Elisa is also an international student from South America, and she would be able to connect well with freshman who are homesick and missing their family while transitioning to a new place. I think Elisa would be able to help them adjust more since she will understand what they are experiencing, and will be able to provide a personal story to help residents connect with her and trust her. ","I believe Elisa would make a great SSM. She is friendly and always looking to develop friendships with those on the hall to help her PLs form a stronger community. She is reliable, responsible and does well in school, which I believe is an important quality in an SSM since it shows they care about doing well at the tasks in front of them and will be a person the Hall Director can rely on to complete the jobs and activities necessary. I honestly think Elisa would be a great contribution to any staff, and would be an awesome SSM who will build a strong community and make bonds with her residents through being their friend and their confidant when necessary, while helping them with issues or concerns they may have.

Robogals @ Georgia Tech is one of many Robogals chapters across the globe. Robogals aims to Inspire, engage and empower young women into science, engineering and other related fields.","Ms. Perakis was part of the Robogal training program, which is an essential stage to train our members and support them to grow as leaders capable of teaching the kids in our workshops and events. I have personally taught Ms. Perks, and she impressed me as someone whose capable of learning very fast. In the first workshop for her, she was a group leader and she did her job splendidly. She was able to perfectly communicate with the kids in her group. I remember that the group she supervised has kept up the pace with the progress of the workshop. She also communicated with me as the workshop leader very well, and kept me informed of her group advancement. She was also happy and pleasant. The kids loved working with her. Thus, I believe Ms. Perakis' strengths as a potential Peer Leader are her fast learning and adjustment, well honed communication skills, and her pleasant and positive presence.","From what I have known about Ms. Perakis I believes she is perfect the way she is. And if any situations arises, I think she would be able to adjust accordingly.","I believe Ms. Perakis to be capable of adjusting to any type of residents. From my experience working with her, I have seen how excellent she communicated with her peers in the training program, which suggests that she could work with upperclassmen of her age or a year older. I have also seen her work with younger kids in our workshops, and I admired how wonderful she led her groups. Although she did a great job in both scenarios, I think she may be a better fit to work first-years. She would be a great example for them to follow. Ms. Perakis would be the best to direct the new students to potential events, activities, and organizations, and other happenings on campus. ","Ms. Perks would be a great choice for a PL position. She has great social and networking skills. She tends to direct people to the opportunities she believes they're fit for. Once she learned what Robogals is about after the training program, she asked if it was possible to set up another program for the girls on her floor.  I told her if we had a good number of interested people, we could. She spread the word and we conducted another training program. That shows how well Ms. Perakis was connected to her community, and how natural it is for her expand it as she was able bring together her floor mates to Robogals. Ms. Perakis is very active and takes her responsibilities very seriously, which would make her a great fit for jobs where she takes the leadership role. Given all that I believe her floor residents would be happy around her. ",,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Yes,No

I see her the most out of any of my residents, and we spend quite a bit of time outside of the hall as well, usually to work out. We have a strong professional and personal relationship, ","Elsa has acted as a counselor for many of the girls on the hall, including myself. She has a great ability to gauge peoples' emotions and she will make time out of her day to make anyone feel better. I often see her sitting with other girls in the hall, talking to them during late hours of the night. A couple times she has also texted me, asking me if I have talked to a certain girl lately. She cares deeply for her fellow hallmates and often lets me and my co-PL that someone is sick out of school before we find out ourselves.   Elsa also organized a team of residents to volunteer for RoboGals this year, while also helping other members of the Grand Challenges Service Committee organize service projects for the Hospital Art Foundation, Trees Atlanta, and Team BUZZ. She is very committed to organizations she is a part of and is definitely driven by the sense of duty to others. Additionally, her openness about her sexuality has also raised the understanding and acceptance of our community and encouraged others to feel free to be themselves. ","I could see Elsa having trouble riding that line between being a peer leader and being a friend. She loves connecting with people and may have difficulties (particularly her first year) in turning people away to take care of herself and or calling people out for making mistakes. This is a more minor issue, but she also has a very messy room, to the extent that it is sometimes difficult to even sit in there. This may become an issue if she wants to use her room to talk to her residents privately. ","Being an international Greek student and given how she has connected with many of the older PLs in our hall alongside the residents, Elsa would work really well with upperclassmen students. However, I think she would get most enjoyment from being a PL because she would get to build close relationships with a smaller number of residents. Her ability to be a counselor would also work better for the problems that first-year students face (as opposed to upperclassmen) because she just experienced that year herself. ","Absolutely!

Elizabeth also is able to remain poised, even under pressure. Whether personal or public, she continues strong, leading with compassion and empathy.","As a potential SSM, Elizabeth will need to become aware of the resources around her so that when people ask for help, she knows where to point them.

She has exhibited great skills in organizing and planning as she had an activity every day to entertain twin 6 year olds (that takes great thought and effort to maintain their happiness.)  She also became very experienced in mediating conflict as sibling disagree every hour.  She worked with them to make them think about the situation and come up with solutions to the problem.  She was also extremely flexible as our schedule changed often and I think that would be an important skill to have as a SSM.,"I think she hasn't encountered certain types of life experiences (example: a terrible break-up with a boyfriend), so she will definitely have sympathy, but will lack empathy in those situations.","I think that Elizabeth would enjoy working with any type of resident, but I can see her really enjoying  the mentoring of the first-years to help them get adapted to college life quickly.  I think she would work well with driven, high achievers, shy people as well as bubbly-outgoing individuals.  I believe that she would struggle to work with those who lost their excitement for learning.","Absolutely, YES!  First and foremost she really wants people to succeed.  She also believes in being firm, but fair.  She won't tolerate any nonsense, but will still be sympathetic and caring to those who need it.  Given that she was able to successfully navigate the challenges of caring for 6 year old boy girl twins (and still come back with a smile on her face day after day) I feel extremely confident that she will be able to care for a dorm full of college students.","Her commitment, loyalty and honesty character levels are off the charts high!",Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,No concerns at all about Elizabeth.

Already in her time at Tech, she has formed a close bond with upperclassmen and graduates at CCF, and when she studies abroad this summer, she will be staying with many of those upperclassmen friends. She is one of the few freshman on my hall that I believe would be VERY successful leading both freshman or upperclassmen. She works well with people with more reserved personalities, as she can bring them out of their shell. She also works well with talkative individuals, though I do not believe she would as much value there, since she may be able to relay as much information in that scenario than in the previous one.","I believe Elyse would make an excellent SSM. As previously stated, her vivacious personality and hardworking yet dedicated spirit would make her a joy to have on any hall as a PL or RA. From what I have witnessed this first semester, she easily forms relationships with others and does not shy away from conflict, an important skill in this role. She is very independent (she was one of the first residents I met on the hall, and on the first week of school, she had already introduced me to many people she had learned from on campus and provided specific examples of things she would recommend for the girls to do on our hall).

With this being said, Emeritus is an extremely personable individual, you cannot help but love this guy. He sets a fantastic first impression and is great with people.","I have yet to see Emeritus act on a more serious scenario where a SSM might need to do. I believe this is because there hasn't been an ocassion where this is asked of him; for some reason there is no dull or sad moment around him, he's just that good. With this being said, I have seen him talk a fellow resident out of drinking through a few quick words on a group chat, not making me doubt for a second that if it was asked of him to make the tough calls or take on a serious attitude.","I believe that Emeritus would be most successful with first-year students. His lively mood really makes people feel comfortable and at home. I can see his personality fitting in with other Peer Leaders, where an enthusiastic attitude can really flip the frown of a homesick student. He has not only expressed his strong desires in working with freshmen students, but he also forms part of Freshman Council, leading activities for other freshman students. He will definitely be that new addition to an older staff that brings the spark they all needed. ","I believe that Emeritus would make more than a good student staff member. He has an extremely positive attitude when it comes to literally anything. He can liven up any dull party, cheer up any concerned resident, and take your plans and make them real. He has experience in freshmen leadership and is a key part in creating the tight-nit community our side of the floor has.

When she wants something, she is not afraid to go for it, especially when it comes to leadership. For example, she ran for president for Hall Council very confidently (and by all means should have won if all factors of voting had been unbiased). She is now part of FAB and I believe she enjoys it very much.","Emily is not afraid to go for what she wants, but this comes with the drawback that if she does not deem something very important to her, she does not waste her time with it. The only potential fear I have is that she might do less with her hall if she views her duties and presence as unimportant, but I truly do not think that would happen, especially considering the fact that she would be a first-year SSM and therefore have lots of enthusiasm towards her new position.","Emily is very outgoing and approachable, so a good trait for both. I think that since she'll be a second year, she will be able to relate to the freshmen the best. But her openness would also allow her to bond early with older students, especially because she knows many older girls from her sorority and socializes with them on a regular basis.","I truly think that Emily would make a great SSM, especially a PL.

He's keen to be involved and to participate and it may take a toll on him over time.","Mr. Mangortey works well with all age groups, though he connects best with the older students.  I would attribute this to his own level of maturity.  If I must choose a group that he works least well with, it would be the first-years in that he is further removed from their 18 year old exploits and might not be able to relate as well.","Mr. Mangortey would make an excellent SSM.  While working with him, I could see that he gave priority to school and to work.  Many students at GTL have some trouble balancing work and play, but Mr. Mangortey had no such dilemma.  He knew where his priorities lay.  He took his job seriously and is very friendly.  He likes working with students and they like working with him.  Though he is friendly and approachable, he understands the need for professional distance when working with students.  ",I can not recommend Eugene Mangortey more highly.  He was an asset at GTL and I was sorry to see such an engaging and responsible young person leave our employ.  ,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Yes,"If you have any questions for me, please do not hesitate to contact me by email at karen.pierce@gtl.gatech.edu.

He believes in everything that he applies himself to and fully dedicates his time and effort into it. He is punctual,dependent,focused and consistent.","Areas of development for Eyoel, one I would say his strength is also a weakness. His focus can sometimes turn into tunnel vision, learning how to better multi task would be an area of opportunity. Also developing a higher level of assertiveness if he wants to become a better leader.  ","I believe Eyoel can relate on many levels with his peers, be it, fresh-man or seniors. His personality allows him to relate with a diverse level of people of all ages and backgrounds.",I do believe Eyoel would make a good ssm. His ability to relate and work well with others would make him an asset to your team. He learns quick and is always willing to teach what he learns to help others. He is an opportunity worth capitalizing on.,You'll definitely miss out if you give him a chance!!!,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Average,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,n a
1 14 2016  2:53:00 PM,Eyoel Tewdros,Courtney Allen,SSM (PL),callen71@gatech.edu,RA PL Recommendation (you have served as an RA or PL the 2016-2017 year),Other (please specify in next question),Classmate,"I have known Eyoel since August 2015, having worked beside and with him throughout the semester in studio (Industrial Design class).","Eyoel remains positive and calm even in the most dire and fraught situations. Having seen him work all day without faltering or being upset, I believe his greatest strength is determination. Once Eyoel sets a goal ahead of himself, he starts running for it and never slows down or goes off track until he reaches the finish line. He's shown these strengths by putting forth extra effort when another group member began to fall behind, making sure the project doesn't fall behind; Eyoel even reached out to other groups and made sure they were on track and offered his help (by way of appropriate measures); and finally for personally interaction, I once was at a low point of a project and was worried it would fail and Eyoel comforted me and reassured me that the project would finish just fine and I didn't need to falter. Eyoel wasn't ever scared or slowed by anyone's emotions but rather took the position to resolve these unbalanced emotions with grace and good virtue. ","While Eyoel is an amazing listener and has great determination, he would be able to improve his techniques of communication and consoling with others. Much like Industrial designers, Eyoel is a sponge and will soak up all that is around him. However he should develop the ability to know when too much is being absorbed and to discover when he himself needs a break. As an SSM, he would most likely develop a more disciplined day-to-day schedule as well. As currently, he goes to class and exceeds well, but outside simply floats around without a goal (until one arises obviously).","Eyoel is a very outgoing and friendly gentleman and I can see him most successful with first-year students, though he could certainly handle upperclassman as well. He was a transfer student and thus did not experience FE, however I believe because of his magnetic and optimistic personality, he could direct freshman in the right and happy direction. As for personalities that work well with Eyoel, I believe that similarly optimistic and excited people are the most compatible, but also the quiet introverted personalities. I've seen Eyoel approach every person he interacts with with deliberate indications that he pays attention to how the recipient wants to be interacted with. As for those that don't work as well with Eyoel, those personalities contain elements of the utmost pessimism and unwillingness to accept responsibility - thus the personality that doesn't pull their own weight and tries to drag others. ","I do believe that Eyoel would make a good - no, great - SSM. Eyoel always has a smile on and makes sure to interact with everyone he has a connection to. And this connection is easily made between him and whoever he sets out. He truly loves to extend his hand out to help others, no matter their situation or background. Speaking of background, as I've already mentioned he transferred, he loves Georgia Tech and inspires others too by way of showing his choice of school after having been to a different college, Furthermore, he is from Africa and thus very experienced in other cultures and open to explore others' or explain his own. He always has an interesting idea, even not all are realistic, anyone is easily drawn in to his charisma of general happiness and will to explore. Any time any feels down or upset, he is the one to go to. Truly, my face lifts up to a big smile anytime, anywhere I see him.","Honestly there is so much more to say about Eyoel (by the way it's pronounced ee-well, I struggled too, so no worries), but I am not a great writer by any means and thus I feel that I don't give him enough justice.  On another note, though I listed him as a classmate, for studio a classmate is so much more than the average. We are a family that struggles through the hardships of high standards, late nights, occasional breakdowns, and wondrous projects. I've seen him through some of worst and best that Georgia Tech can throw at him and he has remained intact and still smiling genuinely.   He's contagious. Just give him one minute - not even that much time - and you'll fall in love him just as I, my classmates, and my professors have. ",Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Yes,I'm an optimistic and happy person as well so I tend to give excellents but there are definitely areas for Eyoel to grow. He isn't perfect by any means but that is what will make him a better candidate.

He is already familiar with the current concerns and requests of residents and has shown improvement in leadership through the year. ,"As the area president of RHA, Frank was at first confused in his role. However, through the year, Frank has managed to learn how to lead fellow residents and approach concerns. He is now fluent in his leadership and adept in leading meetings.","This resident will work most successfully with first-years because Frank exactly knows what it takes to have a successful transition from a high school career. He is charismatic, organized, resourceful, and unafraid of challenges. His personality will work most well with responsible residents and the least well with immature residents.","I believe Frank will make a good SSM as he himself is active with community events and a good resident.

I have never seen her not smiling, even when coming to me with problems and conflicts in her personal life. She has a deep understanding of how to be sympathetic and empathetic of the people around her, and she is perpetually trying to reach out to people in our community. She attends many of our hall events and has attempted to meet all the people in our community.","I think Gabriella can be very outgoing, but will need to learn to stretch herself into a leader on her floor. I think she has an amazing potential to do this, as she fits in with diverse groups of people really well, but leading them will be a new experience for her.",I think Gabriella would work well with first-years due to her own struggles with the beginning of her freshman year that she worked through. She has a lot of relatable experience that could really help the many freshmen who go through the same things every year.,"I think Gabby would make a great SSM. She really cares about other people and is not someone I could ever see slacking or violating conduct rules. She is an incredible generous and sweet person, and one of the most genuine residents I have ever had.","I really think Gabby would fit in well with many residential areas, but knowing the housing areas, I think she would fit in very well with the Cloudman staff or on West Campus. I think she could work anywhere, but her personality leans towards these areas.",Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Average,Excellent,Good,Average,Good,Yes,Some of the above areas marked average are just areas I have not seen Gabby work in yet.

She became involved in the GT organization I work for, Christian Campus Fellowship, and we began meeting on a weekly basis at events and smaller group settings. I know her fairly well.","I am excited to recommend Gaby, because I believe her strengths fit the definition of SSMs very well. When you first meet her, she comes across as someone who is extremely likeable: engaged (eye contact, smile), warm, and a very approachable sense to her. As I have gotten to know her, I have been impressed with how positive she is. We have discussed school, troubles that average freshmen deal with as they enter Tech, family dynamics and other topics. Throughout each discussion, she has been very thoughtful (I can always tell that she is really examining and thinking through thoughts) and never judgemental. She brings energy to her friend group, and her humor is light and also can connect with various people groups. I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Gaby, and she is honestly one of my favorite freshmen to spend time with this year.","Gaby has not had many 'difficult' experiences in her life compared to some situations she may run into (that may be poorly worded, hopefully the examples give clarity) and so there are aspects to students lives that Gaby may need training on. Examples might include potentially suicidal students or students who are in need of financial assistance. I think she would be great with any student, but training on how to best help students in need would be helpful.","Gaby is very easy to get along with so she could work well in any group. I think the way she puts people at ease might make her suited to work well with first years. She connects well with guys and girls. Her friend group is fairly diverse. I'm sure you'll ask her this question, but it might be good insight to know whether she would feel as confident with students who are older than her.","Absolutely. She is a great candidate for this position. She is fun, she is respectful, she is always engaged and responsive in conversations, she is so sweet, she is smart, she is organized. I personally have already asked her to take on some leadership roles at CCF because I trust her. She is someone you would be thankful you hired.","Other than the fact that you should hire Gaby, no.",Good,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Yes,No.

He also told me he has a boarding school experience in which he was in charge of a position like RA position.

I believe that Garrett has good real-world experience and he would be able to act as a mentor for many of the students, regardless of age. ",I do believe that Garrett would be a good SSM. Garrett was responsible and trustworthy. His job as a test engineer required him to be on-call 24-7 for weeks at a time. At a moment's notice he would need to respond to alarms and would need to make critical decisions very quickly. He did this well.,"While at FuelCell Energy, Garrett and I were both on the Safety Committee. The Committee inspected the building searching for health and safety hazards.

Geetika's strenght lies in her optimistic empathetic personality.,"Geetika is a rising second year, so she still learning and perfecting her Tech lifestyle. I think having more opportunities to lead and serve will quickly shape her into an excellent leader.","Geetika would work best with first years. She has experienced FE and went through introductory courses so she can relate better with first years rather than upperclass students. Also, she seems to be very active and involved so she would be able to offer more as a PL because she enjoys having close relations with people and spending time together as a hall. Upperclass students would not be as enthusiastic about her programs and efforts as freshmen would.","I do believe Geetika would be a good SSM. I also am an SSM and I see many qualities in her that prove she can handle this position, and excel. She is a very friendly and happy person, so residents will feel free to approach her. She works great in our 12 person committee and is very respectful of others' ideas, as well as a dependable person, so she will be able to get along well with her staff and HD.

He is also the kind of person to not speak unnecessarily, saying exactly what he wants to and not articulating more. George is also very pensive and could use this as a strength, to understand what people are saying. George is also very inquisitive and would use his desire for knowledge in order to learn how to better serve those in his community. ","George is very quiet and sometimes too quiet. This is often because he is thinking about a situation or using his words wisely. George is also not very vocal about any involvement he has, which can be seen as a standoff approach. I believe that this is because he is very humble and doesn't like unnecessary attention. Working on bringing him out of his shell slightly would be something that a hall director would need to monitor. ","George would be a good fit for first year students. He is a good match for people who are slightly awkward. It seems like he knows how to speak to them and make them feel comfortable. I think that people who are very loud and obnoxious will be a trouble spot for George but as long as he is matched with a good co-SSM, he will have no trouble. ","I believe that George would make a good SSM. He could add a lot to any staff. His mind works in a very different way than most people, always looking for solutions to problems and how to make things better. George has been a phenomenal resident and a great neighbor. He makes people around him better by challenging them to think more rather than talking. I think that I have learned a lot from George and his passion will be very well received as an SSM.

He has an amazing ability to come up with new, refreshing ideas, find the best way to execute them, make sure they are all-inclusive, and make everything a roaring success. Any event he has been able to help with has been exponentially improved by his critical thinking and teamwork skills.","I believe the experience of working in smaller teams or even by himself will be beneficial to Johnny. He's incredible in a big group, but he hasn't had as many opportunities to work with only one or two other people. While I believe he'll still be good at it, I think it's a useful skill to develop early in college.","Johnny's enthusiasm and love for Georgia Tech will make him be a great first impression for first-year students. He'll feed off their excitement to be at college and funnel it right back into them. He'll be the first to recommend organizations on campus or resource available that fit each resident's personality. The only problem he'll have is with apathetic students who do not want to do anything, but I think his infectious personality will eventually get to even the worst of them.","Johnny would be an amazing SSM.

Hanna lived on the floor below me last year and often would hang out on our floor lounge and interact with our community very well.","Hanna's strongest characteristics revolve around her ability to communicate and read situations. She excels in both group and individual scenarios, and understands that different situations adhere to different actions. Her word choice and actions are very flexible depending on the context she perceives and her responses are well thought out. Her ability to fit in with a community and foster a community are astounding.","As an SSM, Hanna would need to work on her time-management skills. Often she swamps herself with classes and extracurriculars. She will need to learn how to better manage her time and organize her priorities so that she dedicates appropriate time to everything and to prevent stress and overload.",Hanna would succeed most with first-year students. She really enjoys being part of a community and being surrounded by others. It's the environment she thrives best in. I feel she would struggle most with residents who just don't want be part of the community and work well with those who want to be involved and want to participate in community builders.,"Oh, I believe Hanna would be an amazing SSM. She was always an integral cog in the clock of our community. Her presence just made us feel better. She provides a sense of home and comfort that not a lot of people have, and her ability to relate and carry on a conversation make her one of the best people to talk to here on campus.

I don't know of any weaknesses, but she may not have had training on dealing with students in crisis.  ",I think she particularly wants to work with the freshman CoS-SMART living learning community.  She was part of this community as a freshman and is a mentor to this community this year through GT1000.,Hannah has been a leader in the CoS-SMART living learning community.  She organizes social activities and has mentored students in the community through GT1000.

She has a bright personality that immediately puts people at ease and she is confident in her abilities. ","If Hannah is selected as an SSM, she will need to ensure she maintains a healthy balance between her work as an SSM and her studies. She is 100% committed to her role as a student so this shouldn't be a problem for her. I've watched her juggle different activities with her studies and she manages very well.","Hannah gets along with everyone, regardless of where they are in their tenure at Georgia Tech or what role they have as a professor, student, team member, etc. I do think she would work really well with first-years, given she'll be fresh off of her own first year. In terms of personalities, Hannah can engage people who are shy and reticent as well as those who are just like her, outgoing and friendly. ","Yes, without reservation. Hannah models the behavior outlined in the introduction to this section of the recommendation. Since SSMs are among the most visible student leaders on campus, Hannah will represent Housing well. Her experience includes positions in which customer service and knowledge transfer is key. Her service experience includes participation in the Ulster Project which provided leadership training, conflict resolution workshops, service hours for local charities, participation in talent show and other social events designed to raise money for the Ulster Project. (The Ulster Project works to reduce the ill effects of prejudice and civil unrest due to religious intolerance.) Additionally, she has been a tutor for students from kindergarten through 12th grade so she has counseling experience with a variety of people. She authentically likes people and has an enthusiasm for Georgia Tech that is contagious. She will serve her residents, her peers and her supervisors well. ","As I indicated previously, I know Hannah because she was a student in my GT1000 class. Since we had just 14 people on our class, it is fairly easy to become better acquainted with our first-year students than it would be in their traditional freshman courses. From the first day of class, Hannah was a serious student who understood the rigors of the Georgia Tech curriculum. It quickly became obvious to me that Hannah came to Georgia Tech, first and foremost, to get an education. In my class, she actively participated in team discussions and assignments, setting a great example for her colleagues. When her teammates graded her for her contributions to their group presentation, each person made it a point to comment on Hannah’s leadership, dependability and willingness to work as a true team member. Her portion of the team presentation was outstanding because she was prepared and knew not only her own material, she knew what the rest of the group was expected to cover during the presentation. As a result of her work, she received the highest grade for this core competency. Finally, I gained tremendous insight into Hannah’s future plans through her career research project. This assignment was not done in haste, rather it allowed Hannah an opportunity for exploration and thoughtful discovery. Should you choose Hannah to be an SSM, I am confident that she will conduct herself in a manner that will reflect favorably upon Housing and Georgia Tech. Indeed, it is my privilege to write this recommendation on her behalf. Please let me know if I can answer any questions. Thank you!

He is hard working, trustworthy, honest, and dependable. And what's more, these traits seem to be contagious. He is truly a leader and a positive influence to those around him. Harrison makes it 'cool' to be a good person. Another trait that will make him an exceptional SSM is his independence and resourcefulness. He can 'get around' with little to no help from anyone. He knows the ins and outs of every system, club, institution, or assignment I've ever seen him encounter.","If this question is asking me to point out his potential weaknesses, I honestly don't think he has any!  ...But if I have to say something, I could point out that he has a fairly demanding major (civil engineering), and if he spends a lot of time studying, that could possibly pull him away from his SSM duties.  But, to offset that, Harrison is extremely resourceful, as I mentioned before.  Being the well-rounded individual that he is, he was always very involved in high school activities, and that never caused any of his duties to be compromised in the past.","I have really only seen Harrison interact with peers his own age, so I'm not sure I can answer this question...  But I will say that he has shown he is mature enough to interact well with his superiors, and gentle enough to guide those who are younger, as well.","I am absolutely confident Harrison would make a good SSM. He is responsible, well-liked, and has a healthy moral compass.  Harrison is a natural leader, an excellent role model, organized, and can be depended on to get things done.","Harrison's father is an assistant principal at the school where I teach. Furthermore, his mom is a permanent substitute teacher for our building. So, not only do I know Harrison in the traditional teacher-student capacity, I know his parents fairly well, too. He comes from a good family, has a healthy family background, and his parents are well-known and respected in the community.

She is my resident in Brown Residence hall,"Hyewon is extremely outgoing and fairly knowledgeable on things happening around campus. She is an excellent listener, and will always come to me with questions if she can't figure something out on her own. I personally think that is a great skill because I believe she would also go to her hall director with questions if she is unsure how something works. Also, she is friends with everyone on the floor despite having a busy schedule as a Gold Rush dancer. ","Hyewon is doing pretty well in all of her classes except for math, so I believe that she may struggle with classes as an SSM. As she gets older, I think she will be able to time manage better, and I think becoming an SSM would help Hyewon achieve that because I know it certainly helped me. ","Hyewon would probably be a better Peer Leader only because she has tons of energy. I can tell that she feeds well off of personalities that are also outgoing and or excited about particular topics. She is very good at talking with the quieter people on my floor by asking them about classes and or something they are passionate about. However, I can tell it is harder for her to get along with people who are extremely quiet (ie give one word answers and such).","Yes, I believe Hyewon would be an excellent candidate for an SSM position.

He has come to floor programs often but hasn't seen the behind-the-scenes work that goes into it. If chosen to be an SSM, this would be a critical area of development for Ian. ","This candidate will be most successful with first years. Because Ian is so social and is a good conversationalist, he would excel in an environment of people willing to meet new people as well.

Ian lives by two noisy residents, and I was so impressed with how he handled the conflict. Instead of becoming angry or disrespectful, Ian asked his neighbors politely if they would mind being quieter. After the situation persisted and he spoke to them multiple times, Ian looped me in and asked for help. He never spoke poorly of his neighbors, and Ian was focused on ensuring that everyone in the community was respected and not affected by the excessive noise. Normally these situations can become tense and create conflict among residents, but Ian’s maturity was truly refreshing, and I see him handling situations as a PL with ease.  ","Ian may need assistance developing relationships with people that are very different from him. On the floor, he tends to socialize mostly with residents of similar affiliations and backgrounds, so he may need a supervisor that can guide him in building a community that celebrates many different interests and backgrounds. Further, Ian’s Georgia Tech community or social circle is outside of Smith Hall, so he will need to balance his social life and community development on the floor as an SSM.  ","Ian will work well with first year students. He seeks an opportunity to develop a tight-knit community with a smaller group so that he can attend to their specific needs. Ian will work well with outgoing and enthusiastic people similar to himself. He will respond well to positive energy and be motivated to do his job well. Conversely, Ian will face difficulties working with individuals that tend to be negative or see the glass as “half empty.” Though I anticipate his positive attitude will help him work through challenges he encounters with potential downers. ","Ian will make a great SSM for the reasons listed above. He is an exceptional communicator and well received by his peers. As a resident Ian has been easy to work with and responsible in handling conflicts. Ian has expressed his interest in the position to me, relaying that being a PL is something he has been interested in since arriving at Tech. Ian is easy to get along with and will be a great resource and friend to his future residents.  ","While all of my interactions with Ian have been positive, he is not very active on our floor. Though I have no reason to think that he will have difficulty forming community as an SSM, his social circles are outside of our hall and when he is in his room, Ian’s door is almost always closed.

Jack also works extremely hard knowing the correct way of doing things.  When a task is given that to Jack does not follow the logically best way of doing something he will let you know of a better way. He usually does this was with tact but can air occasionally in this field. ,In Jack's leadership role of the church he worked with a variety of personalities of younger students.

I am the Youth Ministry Coordinator at St. Mary's Catholic Church and Ms. Tan is one of my prior High School Youth Leaders.,"Ms. Tan is very solution -focused as well as flexible and empathetic.  She attended a week long Youth Leadership training session with our Parish in July of 2014 where she interacted with 75 other Youth Leaders and learned key leadership skills (i.e. communication, problem solving, etc.) While attending the session, she emerged to be a leader among the attendees.  She learned several ice breaker activities, how to work in a team environment, and most importantly how to utilize the gifts and skills of all participants in a group situation to yield positive results.  She is truly a natural leader in that she collaborates to achieve results.  Her Fillipino heritage coupled with her American upbringing make her very approachable to a wide variety of needs.  In July of 2015 she attended a  beach retreat in Florida with 140 youth.  Her small group consisted of 12 teens and the small groups had a dance contest with one another.  She emerged as a leader of her small group and helped choreograph the contest's winning dance routine.  Her natural ability to blend fun while paying attention to detail make her a natural at planning and executing social events.  But perhaps her most compelling  strength is her desire to serve others.  It is this gift that would make her a highly resourceful SSM.  ","Perhaps an area for development would be additional experience in the SSM role and of course training for the role.  Given her service heart and her adaptable nature, she would rise to the need.","Perhaps upperclass students would appeal to Ms. Tan's mature nature rather than the first-years.   That said, she is quite empathetic and would find whatever resources necessary to assist with the situation at hand  (i.e. manage homesickness, assist with making decisions about classes, etc.)","Absolutely.  Ms. Tan is diplomatic, dependable, trustworthy, and has a high level of accountability for results.  She will take her duties and responsibilities seriously without seeming to be overbearing.","My experiences with Ms. Tan have been unique in that most of the time spent with her has been in large group settings where she is required to interact with many peers; not unlike the role she would play as an SSM.  I have witnessed her positively interact and handle diverse situations that at times can be highly emotional due to the nature of the event.  She remains calm, stays focused, solves problems and is diplomatic.  In my role as Youth Coordinator, she has been a source of leadership strength among our Parish (1200 families).

When I asked Jere why she wanted to be an SSM she said 'I'm okay not being the life of the party, but I enjoy getting other people around me to have fun, and this is something I look forward to doing if I become an RA' which I believe is really important when working with freshman because you want them to have the confidence to feel like they can shine in whatever room they go into.

1 14 2016  3:35:00 PM,Jermaine Medley,Anne Lynch,Communications Program Manager,anne.lynch@scheller.gatech.edu,Non Residence Life Staff Recommendation (you are not a RA or PL),GT Staff Member,N A,"I have known Jermaine since the summer of 2014 when he came to speak to me about the Denning Technology & Management (T&M) Program at the Scheller College of Business. It became very clear after our discussion, that the T&M Program needed Jermaine more than he probably needed us. He was already a poised go getter that could successfully network to land high-level internships. (Our program strives to train students to be innovative multidisciplinary leaders and through the two years of academic and non-academic components, Denning scholars interact with our 12 corporate affiliates and their senior leadership.) But Jermaine's positive spirit and willingness to help everyone around him succeed is what makes him shine. It was this aura of embracing the world around him that solidified the Denning T&M Program's need for him to join the T&M Class of 2017. Since his acceptance to the Program, he has stood out as a leader uniting his peers to form a community of teamwork. I serve as the Communications Program Manager and in that capacity I serve as a writing and presentation coach for Jermaine. I have worked with him most extensively on his resume and next year I will partner with him on his presentation skills. ","When reading the above description of an SSM, I find myself nodding throughout the entire passage. Jermaine knows no stranger and constantly puts his more reserved classmates in the Denning T&M Program at ease by initiating conversations and using humor and his warm smile to draw them in. He has assisted in garnering support at our social events and brings enthusiasm with him wherever he goes. T&M is based on working on diverse teams across many aspects of diversity and Jermaine excels in this type of environment. He is also genuinely concerned with the welfare of others and offers solid advice to his peers. He would make an excellent liaison between the administration and the student body. ","I have been at Georgia Tech for almost seven years now and am constantly learning about new resources and opportunities. One area where Jermaine can develop would be to schedule coffee meetings with different administrative leaders across campus to learn as much as possible about all of the services available to students. It would be a great exploratory opportunity to add to the information already accessible. He could also practice adjusting his vibrant energy to match different styles. I actually think he can already do this, but I could see where someone may be intimidated by his confidence and self-knowledge. He is very comfortable in his own shoes, which isn't always the case for everyone at Georgia Tech. There is no need for him to tone down his personality though.  ","I have witnessed Jermaine interactive very well with first-years, upperclass students, and international students. I think he is equally skilled in all areas and could be placed with whichever group had the greater need. ","Yes, Jermaine Medley would most definitely make a strong SSM. As mentioned earlier, the description of 'SSMs are among the most visible student leaders on campus, acting as counselors to all residents. Friendly and approachable, they are tasked with organizing formal and informal social events, mediating interpersonal conflicts and bringing general enthusiasm to the life in the residential communities' has his name written all over it and if you have had the pleasure of meeting him already, you would have to agree. Jermaine can't help but bring enthusiasm wherever he goes and he is able to move between diverse social groups with ease. He has a way about him that diffuses conflict and can garner support for social events. Because of his positive nature, residents would naturally follow his lead and seek him out for advice and counseling. ","I would be happy to speak with you further if you would like to know more, but I feel I have addressed everything in the previous questions. ",Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,"I don't tend to select excellent for everything on these types of recommendations, but I wholeheartedly believe Jermaine Medley deserves an excellent rating. I selected good on creativity only because I haven't had the chance to witness him in that area yet. I assume I will see his creativity next year during his capstone project. "

I served as the mentor for his 'Round Table' initiative at Centennial Place Elementary School.,"Jermaine is an extremely kind-hearted and patient young man. He takes the time to carefully think his way through dilemmas. What I love most about him is his inclination to inquire when he doesn't know something. His main strengths are his humility, ambition, and charisma - hands down. Speaking from years of experience, it takes a wise man to admit that he doesn't know something. Jermaine is not only one to do so, but he is very quick to find out the answer. He is one of the most well-rounded young men that I know and I feel that he would make a terrific RA.","The one area of improvement that comes to mind is Jermaine's ability to accept that he is only human. He places a lot of stress on himself to do exceedingly well in all of his endeavors. Whether it is being a member of Kappa Alpha Psi or teaching a group of elementary schoolers what racism is, I've seen him prepare like no other college student that I've met before. With that being said, he doesn't always take the time to sit back and reflect on his laurels. He simply moves on to the next task at hand. I remember explicitly the day after he finished pledging to the fraternity, he came into my office and began to inquire on expanding his 'Round Table' initiative into Centennial Place Elem. - where he currently runs the program. As an RA, I want him to be able to pause, breathe, and enjoy life on campus.","Jermaine is a very mature individual that gets along with the most difficult people. I see him twice each week and, without fail, he demonstrates kindness and sincerity with everyone that he works with. Personally, I feel Jermaine would work better with students his own age, if not older; simply from the standpoint that he would not feel the need to always guide them. Jermaine naturally takes the lead is ensuring the wellbeing in those around him. Without the hassle of having to deal with younger, more naive students, I believe that he could put more focus into developmental projects for students his own age.","I truly believe Jermaine Medley is the ideal SSM. He is not perfect, but he is genuine. He works hard to better himself and I know that he would inspire others as he has me.",Please consider Jermaine for a position!,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,N A

We initially became friends through a few common classes, and since then we have become very close friends.","Jessica has many strengths that would make her an excellent candidate for the SSM position.  Firstly, she is incredibly personable. The reason we became such fast friends was in part because of outgoing and kind she was to everyone she knows. This is such a valuable skill because it's not always an easy task to reach out to some residents in one's hall, but if you have this mindset and attitude, you can instill such a welcoming environment among your residents. Another strength of hers that would translate well to the SSM position would be her balance of creativity and practicality. Having known her both in the classroom and outside of the classroom, I have gotten to know that she has a great talent for coming up with innovative ideas for school-related things and personal things. As an SSM, I think she her talents in this area would flourish, as it is the perfect arena for manifesting creativity. Additionally, she exhibits a sense of practicality without compromising her creativity, which is equally important in the SSM role, especially when many deadlines are approaching and much is expected of you.","I think Jessica's personality and achievements would make her a phenomenal PL or RA. In terms of developing certain areas applicable to the SSM role, I think the position would encourage her to adjust how she presents herself to difference people depending on a given situation (e.g. enforcing housing policy in tough situations, dealing with a resident struggling academically).","I think Jessica would make an excellent PL or RA, but I think that she would work particularly good with Freshmen in the Freshmen Experience. As I mentioned previous, her positive, upbeat, and encouraging personality would be a great fit with a group of Freshmen who may be reluctant and shy. In conjunction with this, she therefore would be an excellent fit for people who are more generally either reserved but willing or enthusiastic and outgoing. I think the type of personality that would be harder for her to connect with would be the inward, perhaps apathetic resident.","I think Jessica would make an INCREDIBLE SSM. I think the enthusiasm she shows for working with people is really palpable and she is very eager to make an impact in her local community, and the SSM role would be a perfect fit for that. As I mentioned, she displays many of the qualities and characteristics that are desired of an SSM, especially a PL. I think she will be able to build a very strong community where her residents will feel welcome and wanting to participate in the hall community and the Georgia Tech community as a whole. I am extremely excited to see what she will do as an SSM if she is afforded that opportunity,",,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Yes,"I hope that in the interview you find her to be both enthusiastic about the position, yet very reserved and professional and eager to present herself in the best way possible."

She is willing to try new things and has a unique background as an international student from Burma that I think will bring a fresh perspective to any potential staff she joins.","I think that being an SSM would give her the opportunity to learn a lot about leadership since she hasn't had much experience in the past. From interacting with her and seeing how she interacts with others, I think that she has a lot of potential to be a great leader, someone that her peers will admire and look up to.","Ji Eun would work well with upperclass students, although I wouldn't hesitate to say that she has potential to be a great PL as well. She tends to be more hands-off in her personal relationships, but is always there for her friends when they need her which I think would be a personality quality that would click well with the RA position.","Yes! Ji Eun is responsible, motivated, and hard-working, which are all great qualities in any person that you would want to have on a SSM staff team.

Even outside of her duties, Jin sets a shining example of a model student and human being in general. She is pleasant, courteous, and approachable for scholastic wisdom or help.","One thing about Jin is that she does not have a type A personality, which I believe to be a boon when considering apartment culture.

I got to know her very well through discussions about SEVIS regulations, on-campus jobs and leadership, and the transfer process.","Jin is mature and resourceful, astute and knowledgeable. She is a model of academic success, and humble and empathetic. Her demeanor is friendly and she she is a serious student. She relates extremely well to both students and staff, administrators, and faculty. She was the president of our International Student Club at Bard College at Simon's Rock, and she organized activities and provided mentorship.","I am not sure about this. Jin has let me know that as a transfer student she has thrived at Georgia Tech. As a leader here at a Bard College at Simon's Rock, she had a very small community. I think a challenge might be in working in the scope of a university your size.","I think Jin's strength with first year students would be her empathy in understanding the challenges of adjusting and navigating the university.

In making the transition to Georgia Tech, she successfully navigated the challenges of a larger university, and has continued to thrive.

He is a very capable problem solver and has the ability to think outside the box to find a solution.  He will take this position seriously.  I believe he will impress you as he has me. ","I have included a letter of recommendation below that can provide more detail.  If you have any additional questions or would like to contact me for clarification, I am happy to assist.   It is with great pride that I recommend Jon Faris for the position of Student Staff Member. I have known Jon for four years; two years as a student and one as a lab assistant. He was always a high achiever in his chemistry and AP Chemistry classes and both were quite challenging.  He proved himself time and time again with his hard work and perseverance.  These qualities earned him the title of AP Scholar with Distinction and a place in the National Honor Society in which he served as vice president.  Jon was also a lab assistant in my classes for one academic year.  I found him to be very honest, reliable and hard working.  	Jon has many strengths.  He is a conscientious student who excels in his studies.  He is extremely bright, dedicated, reliable and honest.  He has a true gift for science and is a student that really enjoys the challenges of learning in and out of the classroom.

He works well on his own and in a team.  He is very responsible for completing his own work and is consistently willing to help the others around him to accomplish a common goal.  His peers admire him, and this admiration is well deserved.   	Jon has an incredible outlook on life.  He approaches his projects, both personal and academic, with a positive attitude that provides a welcoming atmosphere for his fellow students in which to participate.   He does what it takes to do a job, do it well, and do it right the first time.  He is not afraid to ask questions or to think outside of the box; which is a terrific combination.  I have no doubt that Jon will be a leader and an innovator in his future endeavors, including this job opportunity.  Jon is also a well-rounded student. Jon always goes out of his way to participate in many extracurricular activities such as Key club, chess club, science club, ski club, varsity baseball, and varsity cross country. During his time in high school he was employed outside of the school day and volunteered regularly in his community.   Jon tutored younger students in our district and was a camp counselor for our fifth graders. He also participated in our Mentoring and More program that helps younger students find role models in our community.

He is a valuable member of our hall and a leader both in his classes and in his on-campus activities. He is devoted to succeeding scholastically, and is knowledgeable about the educational resources available to students here. He is also involved in the Aerospace Engineering Student Advisory Council, where he works to facilitate communication between the AE department administration and AE students. Jordan has also told me about his history of leading student organizations back in High School, where his community service work benefited Habitat for Humanity. On our hall, Jordan makes an effort to attend Hall Council meetings and keeps up-to-date with the latest HC bills. He is a valuable member of our floor community and spends time with us whenever he can. Jordan truly has many important SSM strengths: leadership ability, knowledge, and commitment.","One area in which Jordan could improve is managing the balance between on-campus organizations and hall activities. Time management is a skill that is learned over time, and I am confident that Jordan has the potential to expertly manage his organizational and residence-life commitments in the future.","I think Jordan has the skills to work with both first-year and upperclassman students. This is because Jordan is acutely aware of many of the academic resources available to freshmen, but he has the maturity and experience it takes to work with older residents. Jordan's friendly, easygoing, yet caring, personality are a perfect fit for residents of all ages.","Yes, I believe Jordan would make a great SSM because he has demonstrated a genuine commitment to those on our hall. Not only has he forged friendships with several other residents, helping to unify our hall, but he has also made an effort to attend floor-wide and building-wide residence-life activities. These actions demonstrate that Jordan has the appreciation for community that every SSM needs. ",,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Yes,I think Jordan is a model student and friend. He would be a good addition to any SSM team.
1 13 2016  8:16:00 PM,Jordan Marshall,Brenda Keller,"Honors English Teacher, William Blount High School",brenda.keller@blountk12.org,Non Residence Life Staff Recommendation,Other (please specify in next question),Jordan was a student in my eleventh-grade Honors English class,I have known Jordan for two years.  He was one of my former students.,"Jordan is personable, dedicated, highly motivated, and hard working.  He gets along well with all personalities, and he is a caring, generous young man.",Jordan was quite active in community service during his high school years.  He was also involved in a number of organizations in our school.  He was always a leader and quite popular with all of his peers.,"Jordan works well with all people; however, he is especially sensitive to those students who are often 'bullied' and feel 'left out.'",I absolutely believe that Jordan would be an outstanding SSM.  He is one of the most remarkable young men whom I have encountered during my 39 years of teaching in both public and private schools.  ,"I enthusiastically recommend Jordan for this position.  He is that special young man who knows how to balance scholastics and personal life.  He has always been a person whom I could depend upon,.  Furthermore, Jordan's integrity is unimpeachable.",Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,"When Jordan was in middle school, he was often bullied and called a 'nerd.'  He never shared his 'problems' with his family; instead, he decided to face these bullies himself.  On one occasion, these 'bullies' attacked another student and Jordan knew then he had to get involved.  He intervened, and the 'bullies' backed down.  Since that time, Jordan has made it his mission to help those who lacked the self-confidence or had the ability to defend themselves.  While he was a student at WBHS, he organized a group of young men who raised money for domestic abuse.  With his leadership, this club became one of the most popular clubs on campus and raised not only money for a women's shelter but also awareness of this problem.  As a high school student, Jordan was never bullied and, in fact, was one of the most popular and respected students in our school.  Nevertheless, he never forgot what it felt like 'not to belong.'"

Because it was a small (about 16 students) discussion-based course, I got to know Joseph quite well over the course of the term. He is now also enrolled in my English 1102 course.","Joseph is a natural leader and has a lot of experience leading and working with groups of students.  For example, he currently is a youth organizer and leader for Maccabi Tzair CLAM. In this position, he organizes community-building workshops for youth and he’s had experience planning events and resolving interpersonal conflicts. In addition, Joseph is outgoing and easy to get along with—qualities I’ve seen firsthand in my classroom as he collaborated with his peers on group projects. I believe that his leadership and organizing experience along with his enthusiasm would serve Joseph incredibly well in this position.","I'm not quite sure. I think Joseph is really  well equipped for this position. I'm sure that if offered it, he would continue to improve his communication and collaboration skills just by virtue of practice and experience  (which are already strong).","I think Joseph would be great with incoming honors or Grand Challenges students because I think he has experience—and has truly enjoyed and benefitted from—the living learning community of the honors program. In addition, I think he is highly motivated academically and would be a great resource for incoming students. That said, I’m sure he would be great in any dorm!","Yes, I think Joseph would be a great SSM. As I said earlier, I think Joseph’s outgoing personality and ability to talk and work with a wide variety of personalities would serve him incredibly well in this position. In addition, I think he would be encouraging to incoming students and excited to work with them, which would help create a welcoming environment. Lastly, I think Joseph has done a great job connecting with his professors and participating in the broader Tech community. As such, I think he is uniquely equipped to support and help students entering college.",N A,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Yes,I think Joseph would make a great PL and be a great resource and support for incoming freshman.

More importantly, while Josh in involved he is frequently around the hall which helps builds community. He also know hows to rally the residents, when I need residents to show up for something, Josh is one of the guys I go to first. ","There are no major areas of development for Josh. I would say that his room ( a quad) is often messy but I am confident he will have a cleaner room and as a result, a more welcoming room for his future residents",First years would be his best. He would work well in a traditional FE housing on east because he is social and enjoys meeting new people. He would work the least well with upperclassmen and grad students.,Yes. Josh would be a good SSM because he is social and has a solid base. He understands how to get his work done but also enjoys having fun and likes mingling on the floor.

Joshua has the capacity for handling both positive and negative situations in a calm manner. He is passionate about everything he is involved in and makes sure to share that passion with others. His interpersonal and problem solving skills are some of the best I've seen since I've come to Tech, and are also fairly similar to my own. He has a very fun and inviting personality along with strong encouragement skills that will definitely help with engaging residents and building good, trusting relationships. In fact, although he is a second year living in North Avenue Apartments, Joshua has been able to keep up many of relationships he developed on his hall freshman year. In addition, his time management skills are excellent. In question #13 I will list his involvements to prove this.","Although I can think of a couple areas of development, they don't really link to the SSM position. I suppose its possible that he may struggle creativity-wise with events and such, but I have no proof of this, just the knowledge that he has been more involved in participating and helping out with events in the past rather than creating them himself. However, he is the main writer for his band, so his creativity skills probably aren't lacking.","I can see this resident being successful with both upperclassmen and freshman. Joshua's inspiring and upfront personality could definitely keep his freshman involved throughout the school year. However, he can also be laid back and allow people to do their own thing when needed. From what I understand is something upperclassmen prefer from their RA's. Either way, he is capable of accomplishing anything he puts his efforts into, so he won't have much of a problem building the type of community that his residents will enjoy. The personalities he links the best with are simply people that are comfortable being in a small group setting with a good attitude. If they allow it, Joshua will ensure that they enjoy themselves whenever this occurs. He doesn't have a specific personality that he doesn't work well with, but he prefers his co-workers be competent in their positions, so if there are any slackers on his staff there may be some roadblocks in that relationship.","Absolutely. Joshua is capable of producing strong bonds for his relationships in a surprisingly small amount of time. He is also one of the most inclusive people I know and never hesitates to bring two of his friends together even if they didn't know each other beforehand. His interpersonal talents along with his situational skills would go hand in hand in this job, so I am excited to see him apply and hopefully create a great community for GT Housing.","I mentioned before that I would explain Josh's time management skills. His involvements on campus include GT cheerleading, which I can personally vouch for takes at least 16 hours a week during football and basketball seasons. He is also the guitarist for his band Iron Core, which practices at least 3 hours a week and has been in several campus showcases. Another involvement of his is that he is a member of the Phi Sigma Pi honors fraternity here on campus, where he helps with monthly events. All of this and he still makes time to be successful in school and hang out with friends.",Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,N A.

Josh grew up in an area of the country in which he was fortunate enough to live around people of a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. His social circle generally aligns with the make-up of the GT student body, which has prepared him for working with all students without bias or judgment. (As background: Josh's high school is approximately 40% Hispanic, 25% black, 25% white and the remainder of students identify in other racial categories.  Additionally, half of the campus is on free reduced lunch and the other health are wealthy. ) ","Josh, at least as a high school student, was a goofy and sometimes a little bit childish.  Some of the work that resident advisors have to do is very serious.  Josh is more than capable of doing so, he may just need to be trained to handle things solemnly. (Also, many students mature quite a bit when they are on their own for the first time.)","I do not think it would matter all that much, to be honest.  I think he would do equally well with all groups and adapt to their needs.","I do because Josh is approachable and unintimidating. He really does love Georgia Tech in an authentic way, which I felt helped the resident advisors at my university do their jobs well. I also think Josh would do good at working with the adults in his role as a liaison between the university staff and students.","Josh is exceptionally intelligent and learns very, very quickly.  He will internalize any information provided to him almost immediately.",Good,Excellent,Good,Below Average,Good,Good,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Yes,"My only rating reservation for Josh I mentioned on the previous page, and it was the issue of maturity.  I think that there is a decent chance that has already changed because there is a drastic difference between a high school student and a rising sophomore in college.  I scored it authentically and to the best of my knowledge, but it might be currently inaccurate based on natural growth and development.  Also, there is the chance that with additional responsibility he will grow as well."

1 6 2016  6:14:00 PM,Justin Goveas,Kelly K. Huggins,Teen PEP (Prevention Education Program) Faculty Advisor :  Health & PE teacher,khuggins@hcrhs.org,Non Residence Life Staff Recommendation,Other (please specify in next question),Teacher at Hunterdon Central Regional High School,"I am very pleased to be writing this recommendation letter on behalf of Justin Goveas.   I was Justinâ€™s Teen P.E.P. (a Prevention Education Program) teacher during his senior year in high school.  However, I have known him since his junior year.  I want to provide you with a short overview of the course so that you can understand the importance of his role in the Teen PEP program.    Senior Teen PEP (Prevention Education Program) is a group of students who are in their second year of the Teen PEP program, a program which requires application, recommendations, an interview, and acceptance.  Teen PEP students are trained in sexuality issues, such as postponing sexual involvement, pregnancy prevention, sexual harassment, homophobia reduction, STIs and HIV AIDS.  Additionally, they are trained in leadership and facilitation skills.  With the knowledge and skills gained from the course, Teen PEP students facilitate outreach workshops to the 9th graders and Middle School students in the district on sexuality related issues.     As I mentioned, Justin was my student during his senior year, which was Year 2 of the program. ","As Justin's Teen PEP teacher and advisor, I was able to observe Justin apply his skills and strengths in our workshops.  He would perform skits on stage to the underclassman.  He was a strong performer because he was confident, charismatic, and consistently prepared with his lines memorized.  After skits, he and a partner would facilitate small group activities with groups of 10-15 students, guiding them through activities and discussions that related to the workshop topic (which were all related to sexuality issues).  He articulated his insights clearly, he spoke with confidence, he collaborated with his facilitation partner with ease, he was knowledgeable in the content (because he is a very bright young man), and he was very, very likable and personable.  He had great enthusiasm and energy that would motivate even the sleepiest of the block one freshmen!    Additionally, I have observed Justin work with his Teen PEP peers (aka 'colleagues'), developing great friendships with people of all backgrounds (the class is very diverse).  He is open and accepting of so many different people.    Furthermore, he is well-traveled, and he is globally aware.  There is not doubt in my mind that the strengths I observed in him as a high school senior in my program, have expanded, now that he is in college, older and wiser.  He has an extremely strong foundation of skills, and he would make an excellent SSM.  ","Justin is very ambitious and very social.  He has high standards and strives to achieve in all areas of his life.  In high school, he was able to manage a variety of activities, as well as perform well academically.  He was a friendly, well-liked person and enjoyed interacting with others.  He put time into getting to know people, and really enjoyed understanding people's 'stories.'  While it may sound cliche, my only real concern is that Justin would spread himself thin, wanting to be a part of so many college experiences while performing well academically.  I do believe he could learn additional strategies to improve his 'school-work-life balance,' to add to what he has already demonstrated in the past.","Justin would do well with first years.  He is honest and straight-forward in his communication.  If this placement is for next year, which would be his sophomore year, then I think working with freshmen, he would really 'tell it like it is.'  His honesty would help next year's freshmen to see the harsh reality of their decision-making.  He would candidly remind students the potential consequences of their actions.    I do not feel I can honestly answer the second part of the question.  In the setting in which I worked with Justin, he collaborated well with many different types of people.","I've identified many strengths in Justin's character already.  To summarize, he is outgoing, personable, knowledgeable, and confident.  If he becomes an RA, for example, I could see him mentoring underclassmen as they work through college decision-making.  He is a good mentor because he communicates well, and he views situations from multiple perspectives.  He is also very honest, and if someone is making potentially dangerous choices, I am confident Justin would speak up to address an issue, help to educate a student who needs some guidance, and  provide support as they navigate their choices and the consequences of his her actions.",I fully recommend Justin and support him in this endeavor....he would be awesome in the role!  ,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,I am assessing Justin based on his senior year of high school.

Kaie also knows how to set priorities and stick to them. This shows his dedication and responsibility. ,"One thing Kaie can improve on is getting more involved in extracurriculars on campus. He is  has been in marching band, concert band, and working at the cheesecake factory. However, this allows more time for him to spend on this SSM position.","I believe Kaie would be most successful with upperclassmen students. He works well with people who need help but would do better with people who are already on a path or know a little bit about what they are doing. For example, he would be able to help people by directing them to resources that would help them excel in their majors, but may not be as good in helping people decide a major from the start. ",I do believe that this candidate would make a good SSM because of his characteristics and diligence. He will work hard at this position until he can become the best in the position.  ,I believe he would be a great match for the SSM position and would do everything in his power to be extraordinary at it. ,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,n a

She pushes everyone else to be the best versions of themselves by leading as an example which in turn leads to an idea of unity among her team or community. She has an amazing work ethic and is very dedicated to her responsibilities and those around her. In addition to this, she goes out of her way to help others, as shown by her help with special needs kids. She is selfless and cares about others genuinely and will not hesitate to help. She is very empathetic and very understanding with a great ability to appreciate where a person is coming from. Since she can easily put herself in other peoples’ shoes, it makes it very easy for her to relate to other people and coming from many different backgrounds.","Sometimes when she gets burdened down with work, and because she is so dedicated she can become a little more secluded in order to catch up.  ","Kate would work really well as a PL and working with freshman. As stated above, she is quite social and has led a team before as the MVP. Similarly, freshmen will often times look up for an example to follow and someone to take advice from. She can appreciate others’ backgrounds so a PL position where respecting and building community and making the transition from being in high school to college and levels of maturity would be a great asset.","Yes I believe Kate would make a great Peer Leader for all the reasons I have stated above. To hit some highlights though, she is agreeable, sociable, team player, natural leader, respects others and commands respect, genuine, caring, and sincere.","I think that Kate would work really well with every aspect of this job.

She was also a leader of the school's Asian interests Club, for which I served as Moderator.","Kate has the experience and empathy to connect with all sorts of people.  Because she was a success at both athletics (earning city-wide recognition) and academics, her advice gets immediate respect.  She also helped her weakest classmates (one of whom probably would not have graduated without Kate's constant help). She can tailor her approach to different situations, using a gentle good humor to build up the insecure and a wry, insightful humor to to build rapport with the stronger personalities.","Kate's sense of respect to her elders could be a weakness if she were in the position of advising people with more experience than hers.  It is unlikely that she would put herself in such a position, though.",Kate works well with the strong personalities. Even the hostile students gravitate to her; she then helps them warm up and contribute positively to the community. She also does a good job of reaching out to the introverts: her ability to bond with almost anyone over almost anything helps those 'quirky personalities' to open up and feel appreciated.,"Kate's ability to reach out to the strongest and the weakest will make all feel welcome, and her wry good humor will help them overcome any differences. Her example of hard work and good cheer will help them improve their academic lot, as well.","In one 24-hour period as a high-school Senior, Kate presented a paper at a symposium of Catholic schools, she was the MVP when her team won the DC private-school basketball championship, and she gave a model presentation, complete with wry commentary, in my economics class. This exemplifies her wide-range of abilities: her ability to connect with others, her leadership, and her willingness to help people in different experiences.",Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,She gets a lower score on 'Self-confidence' than on other factors because Kate does not yet realize her true potential.

However, she balances her classwork and social life well now, so I know she will be able to make the transition all SSMs have to make when starting the job.","I think Katherine would work well with freshmen women or undergraduates. I think she would have a hard time in an area like GLC or 10th and home due to her lack of life experience.

She essentially shadows me now, so I think she already knows a lot about what it takes to be a good PL and is committed to getting the job done. Also, she seems genuinely interested in becoming influential in her community and helping students any way she can.","Although I think Katherine would be best in a very involved community, I think she could rise to the challenge of any PL or RA position.

In Fall 2015, I chaired an RHA committee that he was a part of.","Kavir is a very loyal person. From his time as a hall council officer, I saw his dedication to his residents firsthand as he willingly takes time out of his already-busy summer to put on events for them. He pushed through (literal) wind and rain to make sure residents who showed up for events didnâ€™t leave disappointed. His administrative skills as a Finance Coordinator was on-point, as the RHA Executive Board never had a problem processing his paperwork and people got their money back on time, every time. I believe, however, that his biggest strength is his ability to relate to his residents. As a very â€œchillâ€ person, he provides a welcoming atmosphere to people attending his hall council events. Striking up conversations about board games, Wii characters and art (he also happens to be part of Georgia Techâ€™s Art Club) comes naturally to him and residents appreciate his easygoing attitude.","Iâ€™ve worked with Kavir first as his hall council RHA liaison and then as the chair to an RHA committee he belongs to, and one area he is definitely growing in is taking more initiatives that go beyond his job description. As he grew in his hall council position, he started taking on more and more additional duties while still having a firm grasp on his own. However, he realizes he still has a lot of growing to do and uses any opportunity he can find to develop that sense of taking initiatives.","As much as I believe that Kavir would serve all kinds of residents well, I think heâ€™d work best with upperclass students. His laid-back attitude is well-suited for students who already have a grasp on life at Tech. All the events heâ€™s organized for his hall council have been very flexible and informal because he feels that programs that allow residents to come at their own time end up attracting more residents due to its accommodating nature (which fits Kavir as a person). He works best with people who are willing to take the first step and reach out to him, since he generally does not force himself onto other people but instead waits for them to initiate contact.","I think Kavir has all the makings of a good SSM. Heâ€™s a people person in the sense that he loves helping people without overwhelming them, which presents him in a more approachable light to residents. He has strong administrative skills, which would come in handy especially during check-in and check-out times when SSMs have to process a lot of paperwork in a short span of time. He also has experience planning and running programs, so he knows what works for residents and what doesnâ€™t. Given the opportunity, Kavir would run with it and make the best experience possible for the residents on his floor.",,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Yes,No

I believe that other students could learn a lot from her in her ability to balance so many activities on campus. Keaira is easily our most well-rounded athlete. ,"This is a tough question, because I don't think age group would matter for Keaira. She would be great with incoming students because she can share her wisdom about her involvement on campus and her exceptional time management skills. For upperclass students, I have no doubt that she would be great leading them as well, as these would be her current peers. ",Absolutely. The summary above about what it means to be a SSM encompasses a lot of the qualities we ask of our cheerleaders.

She has taken advantage of many of the campus opportunities, particularly in extracurricular organizations, so she can serve as a valuable resource to her residents. The applicant is an active listener and understands the flow of conversation well. She asks pointed questions in conversations that leads to interesting discussion. Furthermore, she has a good balance of both extroverted and introverted tendencies; for example, she thrives while interacting in groups, but is also very easy to talk to in a more reserved, one-on-one environment. Also, Keely is very creative and enjoys doing activities such as baking, crafting, making presents, etc. which make her a natural fit for the position. ","I am confident in Keelyâ€™s fit for the student staff member position, and believe her to excel in the areas and skills necessary to be a peer leader. However, her constant interaction with residents and the responsibilities afforded to her by the position will develop her conversation skills, ability to work in a group setting, give her practice in administrative duties, and also will serve as an excellent vessel to express her creative side. Additionally, it would be a valuable professional experience. ","Keelyâ€™s maturity and personality allow her to connect with people of all ages, backgrounds, and personalities. I believe her creativity and diverse interests will allow her to connect most with first- years in a peer leader role. Her enthusiasm and outgoing tendencies will let her forge bonds and facilitate community bonding. Most importantly, her ideas would make for excellent programs, which freshmen are far more likely to attend. Keely as a peer leader would maximize her potential as a student staff member.

She would be able to reach out and built community through group and individual interactions, unique and innovative events, and point her residents to organizations and opportunities that they would enjoy and could take advantage of.

She helped put together our Christmas work party last year. She even went out and bought holiday decorations for the restaurant with her own money to put all our workers in a good mood during the holiday season. Lastly, Kellie works great with others. I could put her with any other cashiers during a shift, and she would get the job done every time, no matter who the other cashiers or cooks were. ","I think Kellie could develop her connections to services around the school more. Because she is only a freshmen at Tech, I think she is still finding services offered around campus. However, I think she will be familiar enough with all campus services by next year that she will be able to connect other students to these services.","I think Kellie would be most successful with first-year students.

Kevin being an overachieving first year, wanted to be a part of every organization and complete every course available to him. Throughout time, he is bound to learn prioritization and time management, and I feel the SSM job would be the perfect opportunity for him to grow in this area. ","Honestly, Kevin could probably work with any student yall throw at him! But I know his passion goes into developing relationships with those around him. I definitely see him fitting in with the first years and being able to provide them with solid advice, guidance, and friendship.

She definitely goes above and beyond and is willing to learn when she does not know.,"Krina doesn't know many residents on the floor. She tries her best to say hello, keeps her door open and talks to who ever walks by so I see the potential, but as of now no strong connections have been made. Krina also goes home every weekend. I talked to her about this, and she said that she would limit how much she goes home as an SSM because she is dedicated to being the best SSM as she can be.","I believe she will be best with first year students mostly because I believe she may feel out of place with upperclassmen, she makes comments sometimes about feeling awkward leading people that are older than her.

Kristina started working at GTRI in Summer 2015 and that is when I really began to know her in a professional setting.  I am the faculty advisor of GTDA and am a Research Engineer II with GTRI.,"Kristina is one of the most approachable people I know and is an excellent student researcher.  She is extremely personable and is a joy to work with.  Kristina is a role model to the other students in our lab and is punctual, efficient, and shows high technical aptitude.  She works very well on our team-based projects and is a reliable and valuable asset to our lab.  From the GTDA side, she is our current secretary for the 2015-2016 season and she takes meticulous notes at all meetings, provides valuable input at board meetings and is always willing to dance with someone new.  As the faculty advisor for the club, I keep an eye on potential students that I want to be the next President of the club.  If Kristina choses to run for that position, I would have no doubt that she would fill that role perfectly and I would not have to worry about anything going wrong with her in that position.  Kristina is a natural leader and is well organized as observed both in her role as a student researcher at GTRI and as an officer and member of GTDA.","Based on my understandings of what is needed as an SSM, I do not see anything that Kristina needs to work on for her to be an SSM.",I think Kristina would work well with any set of students.

I have known Kyle for about six months. ,"Kyle embodies and exceeds every responsibility mentioned above. Kyle has demonstrated a strong ability with developing interpersonal skills among his residents. He has continuously sought to create a welcoming and conducive environment on his hall. I can attest to Kyle's greatest strength being in the area of programming and his hard work ethic, as demonstrated by his role as president of the Residence Hall Association. Kyle is the first to volunteer for any tasks I have during staff meetings and the last to leave events to help with cleaning. Kyle has done all of this while simultaneously balancing a rigorous academic course load and leading two other organizations, including two that he founded: the German Culture Club and the Emory Engineering Society. Kyle was the first Resident Advisor to receive the Coke Legend Award from me, a small token of recognition for being a role model among the staff. Kyle is passionate and enthusiastic about Emory, showcased with his role as a campus tour guide. He brings that wealth of knowledge to his hall to connect first year students to Emory. ","The biggest area of development for Kyle as a potential SSM is learning about the Georgia Tech culture and community. This would be Kyle's first year on campus (by default because of his desire to pursue a Master's degree) and the first time working with a different population of students. While I have no doubt that Kyle will adjust and be a beacon of light on the staff, it will still take some time for him to adjust to the shift. ","Kyle has the most experience working with first year students but I think the nature of his standing as a graduate student will position him to work with graduate residents. I think that Kyle will excel with graduate students because he will bring the experience of working within a university that strongly emphasizes community building and connections within the first year experience. While the demographics of the residents will be different, Kyle will bring his experience and creativity to connect graduate students that may not otherwise care for the traditional community building activities. I know that Kyle will have a servant-leadership style that will assist in catering to the unique needs of graduate students. Kyle works extremely well with peers that have a passion for their position. I think he works least well with those that have a lackadaisical attitude. ","Absolutely.  After working with Resident Advisors in multiple capacities over the past five years, Kyle is definitely what I imagine when I think of a great RA. He has a passion for the position and a willingness to learn. He will develop a strong relationship with his supervisor and adapt to their needs and expectations. I think Kyle's experience working in a multitude of positions within Residence Life at Emory will set him up for success at Georgia Tech.

I view Kyle as an optimist because he refrains from having or expressing a discouraging mood. These attributes, along with his desire to serve the community, awarded him the position of finance coordinator on the hall council of Center Street Apartments. There he has often helped me with the reimbursement process and provided tips on how to persuade the residents in order to pass a bill. Throughout last term, I witnessed Kyle becoming a responsible officer while maintaining his cordial manner.","One of the necessary skill of an SSM is to be a effective event programmer. While Kyle has the remarkable experience as a finance coordinator to help organise events, gauging residents for interests and setting up successful events with high attendance will his priority as a first-year SSM.","Kyle has the energy and enthusiasm to become a PL and lead freshmen students, but he is a rising senior. I believe he has the potential to be an RA and build the same community a PL can build.   Kyle is an extrovert, so he is very likely to get along with people who enjoy to share, talk and spend time with others. On the other hand, I know Kyle is also able to spark excitement in others, for instance, he managed to convince all of his very busy roommates to go to Six Flags where they had a wonderful time. One personality Kyle might have a challenge working with is the tendency to be left alone.","When I get to know my residents, I would also try to determine who can be a suitable SSM. Kyle was one of the first residents I met and he was one of the few who was interested on my concerns and problems. Knowing that it was my first year as an RA, he would attend my mid-week munchies and converse with other residents. He would also show up to hall council events, not as a participant, but as a volunteer, even though his role as a finance coordinator is to ensure the paperwork is in order. I remember him promoting CSA's drink during the Music & Mocktails event, talking to attending residents and preparing drinks at the same time. Kyle wrote me an accolade through 'Of the Month', where residents write about something that made them happy in their residential lives. The text not only motivates me to be a better RA, but shows Kyle's appreciation for the position. All in all, Kyle has the skills and the mindset to be a valuable SSM.",One major trend in Tech is that students loose their enthusiasm as they progress through school. I saw this through the transition from freshman experience to undergraduate apartments. Kyle is one resident that has impressed me with his activeness. He can provide a lot of guidance with this virtue.,Excellent,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Yes,I have no concerns nor reservations in recommending Kyle.

Kyra is interested and excited about the prospect of mentoring students close to her age.   As of now, Kyra works most well with personalities who are outgoing and willing to introduce themselves and start up a conversation. She works least well with personalities who are shy because she is also shy and has difficult being outgoing with people she is unfamiliar with or hasn't yet met.

She came into school with a very clear focus on trying out student organizations and getting involved as fast as possible.  She is both a knowledgeable and friendly person and I believe she would interact well with students on a floor.  I have watched her navigate her first semester as a student with a lot of maturity so I know she would do her best to help other students do the same should she fill a PL position.  She has a lot of drive and her youthfulness brings energy.,"Being a 1st year currently, she is still young.  She is also a bit of a perfectionist, so she may be hard on herself.","I can see Kyra working best with first-years.  She would work best with people who are shy, overwhelmed and need guidance.  I would guess she would have the biggest struggle with the students who are apathetic and do not care to respect authority because she is very driven and respectful herself.","Yes, I do think Kyra would make a good SSM!  I think she would be successful at taking her personal experiences and helping others walk through them.

Lily and several of her friends approached me with an idea for planning a Woodruff South White Elephant Gift Exchange before winter break.  I helped them brainstorm and offered to support them by providing refreshments, but they took the lead with the event.  Lily worked with her friends to make decorations and a holiday 'photo booth,' advertise through fliers, and even create a playlist of holiday music for the event.  Turnout was high, and the event was fun and engaging for all who participated.  This event took a lot of time, and demonstrated the energy that Lily would bring to the SSM position.","Lily's bubbly personality makes her fun to be around, but I think she would have to learn to put on a more authoritative persona when handling duty incidents, for example.  However I believe she would be able to learn this quickly.",I believe that Lily would be most successful with a first-year community.

She was quite organized and carried out the duties I required in timely manner.  I intentionally teamed her with a freshman since she had the maturity to act as a 'mentor'  during their doubles matches.  One of the duties she had was to plan team activity (e.g. spaghetti dinner) Also, Lily is quite intelligent and well spoken.  ","This is a somewhat difficult question to answer, knowing that over the course of her freshman year I would guess that Lily has grown.  Yet as a senior in high school knowing her on relatively limited basis I considered her a well rounded individual. ",One of the reasons I paired Lily with a freshman was her empathetic  nature.  It was a good pairing.  In my experience with her she seemed to be able to work with all types of 'personalities'.  The type of person I would imagine is the most difficult is someone who is not focused or disorganized.  ,"Yes I believe that Lily would make a good SSM.  She is organized, empathetic, enthusiastic, flexible and focused. Still she is a relatively easy going and likable individual   ",I really don't have a great more to add.

He is a great listener and is adept at discerning when to give advice and when it is better to provide support. His abilities to bring enthusiasm to a group and make everyone feel welcome are key points that will help him should he become an SSM.,"Austin should take some time to determine how to engage in the interests of others more actively. Often, he is very passionate about his interests and will voice his opinions, but may (seemingly) lose interest when discussing things outside of his expertise. I think it is important that he take the time to understand how he should use discussions about subjects with which he is unfamiliar to his advantage, and be able to become a more active listener and conversationalist.","I think Austin would be most successful with first-years; his personality is very welcoming and encouraging, so he will be very helpful for new students to become familiar in the Tech environment.  Austin works well with most personalities, but I would say he may have the most difficulty with people who are very reserved and keep to themselves. He may not know how to engage them, if necessary, and may unintentionally push them away if they approach him, as he might struggle to connect with their interests if they don't align at all with his own.",I believe Austin would make an excellent SSM. He has the skills necessary to make almost anyone feel welcome and is fantastic at fostering a healthy community environment.,N A,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Average,Good,Yes,N A

Her senior year she came to me for help with AP Physics as well as assisted me weekly with some of my teaching responsibilities  such as grading and lab setup.,"Maddy is easily one of the most socially adept students I have had in my decade of teaching experience. She has wonderful interpersonal skills and was well respected and liked by her peers and the faculty. She is easy to talk to, is good at managing groups of students, and has a wonderful work life balance for someone her age. She also is dedicated and hardworking to whatever she puts her mind to. Having never played competitively before, she started and built up a Chicago City Championship Lacrosse program at our school. As someone who runs many clubs and activities, I know the skills involved with managing schedules, maintaining interest and discipline, and relating to students on a professional but still personal level are integral to an RA position and skills Maddy not only has but has refined over the years. ","Maddy is kind and holds herself to a very high standard. Additionally, the high school she attended and where I know her from is one of the top rated public schools in the state and draws the best students from all over Chicago. All of my interactions with Maddy took place in this environment, so I do not know how she would relate to students who are not as driven or focused as she. That said, our school is the most diverse school in the state. I would not be concerned with her interaction with any particular group of students as she is from as diverse and rich area socio-economically, ethnically, and racially area as is possible to have. ","My guess is first or second year students, although I have no doubt she would be excellent working with anyone. I have never seen her have a negative interaction with another person. I know she is able to work with all kinds of personalities. Maddy is someone who excelled in my physics class working with some of the best students in Chicago and who started our school's womens lacrosse team and then built it up to a city championship program by her senior year, so she works well with many different types in many different environments.","Yes. As someone who was an RA for two years in college, I recognize many of the skills that were looked for by our staff in potential SSMs. Again, she is hard-w0rking, reliable, polite, fun, and likeable. ","During Maddy's senior year she was in a class with one of my colleagues who is notoriously difficult to deal with amongst both students and faculty. She handled the year with no complaining and a wonderful level of grace. My coworker had nothing but nice things to say about Maddy, and she made the best of a rough situation.

1 9 2016  2:19:00 AM,Manali Desai,Faizan Virani,Peer Leader - Glenn,fvirani6@gatech.edu,RA PL Recommendation,Other (please specify in next question),Colleague,I met Manali in Fall 2014 and have been in constant regular contact ever since.,I know Manali to be a particularly passionate person when it comes to the things she is involved in. Take for example her efforts to gain experience in the medical field. She puts in a lot of work to get involved both in and around campus and most if not all these endeavors help to supplement her goal to go to medical school.  Its obvious that Manali can strongly get behind what ever it is she puts her mind to.,"Manali is has an incredibly nice personality which she carries with her where ever she goes. This is great but could be something she might need to hold back on when it comes time, in the SSM position, to be more confrontational with residents. ",I feel like Manali would be a great asset as a PL rather than an RA. She has a lot of experience mentoring others (a huge part of the PL job) and she is the kind of person who can easily make meaningful relationships with her residents. Her particular academic and extra-curricular experience would also make her well suited to work in a pre-health living learning community.  ,If I didn't think she would be a good SSM I wouldn't be writing this recommendation for her. Manali would be an excellent addition to the SSM community and I highly recommend her. ,,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Average,Good,Excellent,Average,Good,Yes,"No additional comments necessary, her application will speak for itself I'm sure."

She always has a smile on her face. She made my job as a Peer Leader very easy because most of the time, she was making hall events and bringing residents together. She really liked to involve herself in housing events by going to all the hall council meetings, becoming a hall representative, getting to know her hall very well along with the residents in the neighboring halls and always having great ideas for our hall. She has assisted in a hall pot luck on Thanksgiving, fondue on Valentines day, weekly fitness events, along with other countless events. Overall, Manali is a great leader. She is super friendly and knows how to handle situations very well. She has a great personality that allows her to get along with anyone. She enjoys being busy and I know she would make the SSM position a top priority along with her academics. She is a very motivated and driven young lady and I am very pleased to recommend her for the position. ","I remember when I first met Manali, she wanted to run for President of Hall Council. I helped her deliver cookies to residents door to door while she explained to them why she would make a great President for Hall Council. She started off her speech with little confidence and I can tell she was very nervous. She ended up not getting the position however she remained very active in hall council. However, after a full semester, she started passing bills and talking at hall council with a lot of confidence and poise. I noticed a major improvement after just a few months. Manali is a great leader, but I know she has the potential of being a much better leader. I know a SSM position will really help her grow as a person and help her be a better leader. She will be able to plan events on her own without having to consult with someone first. This job will really allow her to be more independent and will give her the confidence she needs to be an excellent leader. ","I think Manali would be most successful with freshman. She has a lot to offer with her own personal experience as a freshman, choosing the right major, joining the right clubs, etc. I think Manali would work best with those who are younger than her because she is very helpful so I know her freshman residents would come to her for advice. ","Yes, I believe Manali would make an excellent SSM. She has all the qualities of a great SSM as a Resident Assistant and as a Peer Leader. I believe a SSM should be easy to talk to and very open to any type of conversation. That's why I think Manali would make a great fit for this position, because I can see her talking to almost anyone. If there is a conflict, I know Manali would handle it and make both parties feel like they are being supported. Manali is very professional but she also handles everything with a smile, which would make her an excellent candidate. On top of being easy to talk to, she is organized, motivated, and always has great ideas. ","Manali is involved in a lot on campus, so she would be a great resource for her residents. She is very knowledgeable about Tech Tradition, academic resources, clubs and organizations, and fun events. ",Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,"Manali would make an excellent Peer Leader because she is a great listener and is always present. She is very approachable and is always willing to help others. Since a position of a SSM is also a lot of paper work, Manali is also very organized and completes assignments in a timely manner. I am honored to recommend Manali as a potential SSM. "

Mary will do what's right no matter what the crowd is doing she has a strong moral compass and respects the rules for what they are.,Mary has a great potential for growth in reaching out to less active residents. It is easy for many SSMs to put residents they don't see very much out of their minds. I believe Mary would accept the challenge and try to connect and create a substantial relationship with each resident. She would learn how to create a place for every resident in the community.,I believe Mary would work best with upperclassmen students. She  is compassionate and encouraging but not overly enthusiastic or energetic as many first-years need. Mary works well with both laid-back and high-strung individuals.

We have had multiple discussions about programming possibilities that would be attractive to the graduate population in our area, and he is already working with me to put together some of our early spring events.",I think that Matthew would thrive in the SSM role and would gain more soft skills that would be beneficial for his future work in any field that he goes into.,"Matthew would work best with upperclass undergraduate and graduate students.  I think that the age difference would make it difficult for him to work with freshmen.  Matthew works best with open, direct people, and may need to work harder to adjust to working with people that use an indirect form of communication.","I do.  As soon as Matthew moved into building F he expressed interest in getting involved in the community.  He actively sought out hall council and area events, and has always been eager to participate in events and skilled at coming up with innovative programs that are well suited for our unique housing area.",I have been very impressed by Matthews initiative and interest in housing.,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,"If hired, I would look forward to working on staff with Matthew in the upcoming academic year."
12 16 2015  11:01:00 AM,Matthew Zwolinski,Matt Lally,News broadcaster producer,Mattlally04@gmail.com,Non Residence Life Staff Recommendation,Other (please specify in next question),Served as Vice President of our fraternity when Zwolinski was house manager,I've known Mr. Zwolinski for 8 years dating back to our time as undergrads at Auburn Univeristy. We both held leadership positions in our fraternity. Matt was the best house manager we ever had. ,"I've seen Mr. Zwolinski in this sort of position already first hand. His duties as a house manager required him to schedule cleaning duties, mediate problems between work crews and ensure house rules were followed. In a house of 20-22 18 year old boys, this is no small task. He handled the responsibilities with great care and took his job seriously. He was the enforcer of house rules but also knew how to be diplomatic. I know with his background as house manager he is up to this task. ",Mr. Zwolinski's passion and care for his job can sometimes be mistaken as him taking the job too seriously. But his personality and charisma should be able to show the residents that it isn't anything personal. ,"I think with Mr. Zwolinski's background he should be able to deal with any manner of students thrown his way. During his time as house manager, he was responsible for dealing with students of all ages, from freshmen just entering college, to 5th year seniors who may have thought they were too cool to follow the rules. Mr. Zwolinski isn't able to handle each person on an individual basis and not just group everybody together and treat them the same. ","I believe he would make a great SSM. He's fun, outgoing but at the same time knows when it's time to get serious. I believe any RA has to know how to toe this line to maintain the respect of the residents he is in charge of. As house manager he always had a knack for knowing when he needed to crack down but also when he could back off and let the groups do what they needed to do to get the chores done. I believe he can bring those same qualities to this position. ","Just to sum up my thoughts, I believe Mr. Zwolinski is wise beyond his years. And he could be a valuable person residents could come and talk to besides just residential issues. He's been through a lot and may be able to help give younger students guidance on problems they may be having. ",Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,"I always said in school that if we all had the work ethic of Matthew Zwolinski, we could rule the world. You will never meet a person who works harder at anything he puts his mind to. He will be a valuable asset to your group. "

Indian culture is one where blunt remarks are expected and diplomacy is not always necessary. Thus he comes off as a little brash at times but always has good intentions.

During my encounters with Micah, he showed a consistently positive attitude towards others and always seemed excited to welcome others into an activity. His peers enjoyed his presence because he would bring enthusiasm into the group. Micah also initiates conversations with others without timidity, showing an honest interest in how others are doing. He goes beyond a simple greeting and takes the time to listen, even if the individual was not expecting to exchange more than a simple greeting.","As a potential SSM, Micah can continue developing confidence and holding an objective stance when facing confrontation. At times, I observed Micah showing low self-esteem when he experienced academic and physical obstacles. Although he expressed his doubts about himself at times, he would soon return to his usual enthusiastic attitude. I have also observed Micah struggling to stay objective when his peers were in conflict. Through training, I believe Micah will learn how to navigate as a mediator during conflicts.","I believe Micah would be best suited to lead first-year students, although he would be a strong SSM for upper-classmen, also. Micah’s enthusiasm and initiative would greatly serve first-year students who seek positive-minded leaders. His thoughtful interest in others would also reach first-year students who may be timid or may face difficulties during their transitions. I have not seen Micah work poorly with any certain personality. However, I see that he works best with agreeable initiators, as he enjoys being an enthusiastic follower behind a cause. I predict that he may struggle working with very assertive or overbearing personalities, as he can be sensitive towards others’ strong attitudes or comments.","Micah exemplifies, through his past involvements and attitude, that he would be a great SSM. During his first year, he was very involved in the hall, often serving as an active presence during Hall Council meetings. Micah rarely spent time alone because he enjoyed studying in groups and spending time with others, always taking each opportunity to connect with others. Additionally, his passion for joining in on any activity—whether it may be helping a friend or attending a Georgia Tech event, helped his peers unify as a group. Although Micah was often seen with a group, Micah also exemplifies concern and care for individuals. Micah takes the time to ask others how they are doing and shows patient empathy when listening to others. Through his positive influence and genuineness, I believe Micah will succeed as an SSM.",,Average,Average,Excellent,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Yes,No

Being such an integral part of the community that I lived in last year, Mike demonstrated great leadership and interpersonal skills. Not only was he part of the community, but spoke up for the community in group settings as well as in Hall Council. He attended most, if not all, of the meetings, and showed passion in representing his floor. Mike carefully reviewed each bill and listened to every discussion in order to seek what was best for his floor and his residence hall. On top of his social skills and passion for community, Mike is an astute and enthusiastic scholar. Joining academic and professional organizations, Mike is always eager to seek new challenges in both his community and academic career. He has demonstrated the most accurate characteristics to that of a student staff member: caring for his community, showing leadership to enhance and enrich his community, and serving as an academic and personable influence to the people around him. Mike's strengths and qualities are what makes him stick out from the rest of his peers, and has shown to be an extremely strong applicant to the student staff member position.","While Mike is an astute and strong leader, the SSM position can unequivocally help him develop further interpersonal skills and challenge him to initiate events within his community. Being such a heavy influence to the people around him, Mike can learn to yield to his staff members, listening and supporting their ideas and decisions rather than pushing for his own. Additionally, the SSM position can challenge Mike to create and execute his own events within the community, and learn that he can receive support from the rest of his staff members. I truly believe that the SSM position will help Mike in these areas, and Mike, on the other hand, will bring the best of his strengths to his staff.","I believe that Mike will work best with upperclass students rather than mostly first-year students. This is because of his level of maturity, sense of professionalism, and advancements in his academic career. He would best work with initiators, maximizers, and challenge-seekers. On the other hand, he would work least well with those who are apathetic and unresponsive.","I believe Mike would make a superb student staff member. Being a peer leader, mentor, and friend to him has given me the privilege to observe strong qualities that fit the qualifications of that of an SSM. As I had mentioned in my previous responses, Mike demonstrates distinct leadership, great interpersonal skills, and a caring heart and passion for his community. I highly endorse Mike as a strong candidate to the student staff position.","I am extremely happy to show off my resident and friend in this application. I feel enthusiastic and passionate about writing this recommendation and would not mind elaborating furthermore about Mike. He is an exemplary student and peer to work with, and I give him my respect for that.",Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Yes,No concerns for this applicant.

As director, I select, train, and supervise our staff members who facilitate the training. I first met Mihir when he attended our programs as a junior high school student. I was then thrilled to accept his application to serve on our staff throughout his high school years. It has been my privilege to know and work with him for 7 years. ","Mihir is both outgoing and quite approachable. He connects easily with his peers. He is a very rational thinker and is able to find effective, creative solutions to challenges or conflicts that may arise. Mihir is extremely reliable, always following through with his commitments, and doing so competently; he holds himself to very high standards. He is a wonderful role model for others to follow. Most importantly, Mihir is compassionate toward others and is driven by his passion make a positive impact. ","In my experiences working with Mihir, the area that sometimes required attention was personal stress management. As a very high achiever with lots of interests and involvements, he can become very stressed. He has made major improvements with this as he has matured. ","I think Mihir would be wonderful working with mostly first-years at this time, He loves to share his knowledge and experience and help to guide others toward their own successes. He works very well with others - regardless of differences in personalities. He seeks to find commonalities and builds from there. ","I believe wholeheartedly that Mihir would be an excellent SSM. As I read the 'job description' at the start of this recommendation, I was able to say that he meets (and exceeds) every requirement and expectation. I am 100% confident that he would very positively impact all with whom he works, both SSM peers and residents alike. ",I honestly can't say enough good things about Mihir.

This is an important trait among Student Staff Members, and would make Mihir a valuable addition to any staff on campus. ","I have enjoyed watching Mihir's leadership abilities improve over the past semester while spending time with large groups of residents, and I believe that his skills would continue to improve while on staff. He has devoted time and effort to growing more comfortable with large groups of residents while at dinner or studying in the lounge. This skill will undoubtedly continue to develop over time, possibly even more quickly while on staff. ","Mihir has expressed interest in working with both freshman and upperclassmen, and I believe that both age groups would benefit from his presence on the hall. He is mature enough to handle situations involving older students, yet humble and patient enough to bond with a freshman who is new to Georgia Tech. I have noticed that he gets along with students that aren't typically social, which is not an easy feat. Mihir's calm demeanor allows him to work well with students that have strong, loud personalities, yet he is still working to improve these relationships.

Neel has also been involved on campus through being a referee at the CRC, and is always informing me of other fun events on campus. I think he would be an incredible resource for freshman who want to find where they fit and can get involved at Tech. He has is a go-to person for me and all of our other friends. His future residents will be lucky to have him.","Neel trusts people. This is so much so that he may not immediately realize it if a resident is not being truthful to him. However, I think that once he becomes acclimated to the position and with training, this will not be a problem, and he will be more mindful.","I think Neel would work the best with first-years because he is very easy to talk to, and I think he could really help them get acclimated and flourish at Tech. He would maybe work the least well with upper classmen, only because they tend to do their own thing, and he might have a more difficult time organizing events everyone could come to.","Yes, Neel has all of the qualities that I think a good SSM needs. He is friendly, responsible, and an amazing friend to everyone. Unlike many, he has his stuff together. He can build relationships easily.

With that said, Neel would mesh well with outgoing first-year students looking to get involved on campus.

I am a Junior Advisor for the Freshman Activities Board (FAB), and we interviewed Nick and selected him out of 415 applicants to be a part of our organization of 30 members. I interact with Nick through our weekly meetings on Tuesdays, as well as communication through GroupMe throughout the week.","Nick's biggest strength is that he is a leader. But, Nick is also aware that being a leader does not mean closing yourself off to growth in leadership skills or styles. Nick is not shy; he is not afraid to speak his mind or take charge. He also has one of the biggest personalities I've encountered. In addition to his strong work ethic, Nick is goofy, fun-loving, outgoing, and just plain nice. I think that students at Tech would feel comfortable talking to him, or simply hanging out with him. In his time in FAB, I have seen Nick grow, which I believe is a very important quality; Nick is quick to adapt. A recurring activity we do in FAB is the color test, which examines different personalities and leadership styles and helps teach people how to interact with others.  Because of this knowledge, Nick is able to recognize how to speak to people that will be most effective. In addition, Nick has already had experience in FAB with planning events and the different resources available for freshmen. Nick has many strong qualities that make him suited for an SSM position. ","As previously mentioned, Nick has a very big personality and has strong leadership skills already. Because of this, he tends to take charge in groups, even when others in the group are capable of taking charge as well. I believe this is an area that Nick can grow in, and that a SSM position will help him grow in. Splitting the responsibilities and relinquishing that control is an element that  many people struggle with, but I do believe with time and knowledge, Nick will master this skill. ","I believe that Nick would excel with working with first-year students. As a member of the Freshman Activities Board (FAB), he already has learned how to provide for freshmen's needs in different ways, so I think expanding on his current knowledge and skills would be an easy transition. Nick works well with high-energy personalities, or ones that are receptive of his high-energy., but realistically, Nick could get along with anyone. Nick tends to work less well with students who are quiet because he can overpower them from time to time, but encouraging rather than hampering the smaller voices in a group setting is a goal he is working on in FAB.

They know that he will follow the rules, and respect his authority.  Authority can be given, but in this case others see Priyesh in a supervisory role because of their respect.  In addition, he has served as the leader of numerous clubs and organizations through out high school.  He would organize and was considered the heart of his class.

She has an unshakeable sense of humor that I believe helps her and those around her work through tough times, and makes every conversation with her a pleasure.  I believe that her approachability would facilitate trusting relationships with her residents, and that her good-natured sense of humor would help her inspire residents to be optimistic even when classes and campus life prove to be challenging.  I also believe that Rachel understands the importance of facilitating community, which is the primary role of the SSM.  She helped another resident organize a White Elephant Gift Exchange before finals for the residents of Woodruff South that was very successful.","I believe that Rachel would have to learn to temper her sense of humor during some situations encountered by SSMs.  Although this quality makes her a fun person to be around and would be crucial to her success as an SSM, she will have to learn to put on a more serious persona when dealing with duty situations, for example.  However, I believe that she will be able to do this easily.","I believe that Rachel would be successful with many types of residents, however I believe that her personality makes her best suited for working with first-years.  She would bring a lot of energy and fun to a community, which I believe is important to help first-year students build a community and work through the stress of being in college and away from home for the first time.

However, I have found that Raeedah always takes time to ask me about my life. Rather than the mentor-mentee relationship I expected, I really feel like we are friends. This would translate so well into an RA or PL position because Raeedah is able to focus on others and develop friendships through her caring and friendly attitude.","While Raeedah is becoming part of the GT community very well, she is still only in her 6th month on campus. As such, she may be more unfamiliar with the resources available to students. Having an RA or PL position would further her involvement and give her the opportunity to learn more about all campus has to offer!","I believe Raeedah would work best with first or second years simply because of her age. She is still going through her freshman year, so the joys and struggles will be fresh of her mind when she is a SSM next year. She is also an out-of-state student, so I believe that she could really connect with freshman who are adjusting to being away from home. I think Raeedah will work best with the 'typical Tech' students who are nervous to meet new people because she is very relatable and approachable.

Because I feel that working with first-years requires an increased level of tact, I think Raghav would be well suited to work with them after some more progress in his areas of development.

Our relationship started from eating at the dining hall together to impromptu conversations in the hallway.,"Regina is skilled at seeing a project through. When she starts something, she is determined to finish it. She is also passionate about a variety of things, making her relatable and easy to talk to. She is also hilarious in a way that only Regina can pull off, which makes her easy to approach. She is also creative, artistically and conceptually. Regina has proved that she can come up with unique plans and has the ability to carry them out. She is confident in herself but also isn't afraid to ask for help when she needs it. This, in my opinion, is an excellent quality for an SSM candidate because it is a position that requires a certain level of knowledge but also the ability to continue growing and learning. ",Expanding her experiences. Regina is involved on campus but I think that as a potential SSM she has the ability to gain new insights from new experiences that are vastly different from the ones she has already had. Another area of development could be working in large groups and being able to voice her opinions in a group setting. ,"This candidate would be most successful with first years because she works well with both introverted and extroverted people, although she is more of an introvert. She would be great at bringing a diverse hall together. ","I believe that Regina would make a good SSM because she is the type of person that is willing to put forth the effort to create a community. She has fully embraced the Open Door Policy and has built several relationships with people on the hall. She has already planned a formal program, created the advertisements, and purchased the supplies with the help of only another resident. She is also genuinely kind. She never fails to ask about my day whenever I see her and actually cares about my response, practicing active listening. ","Regina is truly one of a kind. She is a pleasure to have as a resident. Her knowledge spans over various subjects and she never fails to surprise me. As an SSM candidate, she has a lot of space for growth but the potential is there.",Average,Excellent,Average,Average,Good,Good,Below Average,Below Average,Average,Good,"Yes, but with reservations","Regina may come off as shy at first but once she comes out of that cocoon, she blossoms into a butterfly.

However I do believe he has the capacity to handle serious things, he may just need to work on it some.  ",He would be great with first years.  He would also do well with upperclass students as he is a very mature student who is ahead in his studies.

Even though he has only been here a few short months, Robert's potential impresses me and I think this opportunity would be a great stepping stone for him.",I think that Robert sometimes needs to look at the whole picture.

He is a leader in a group of 30 diverse first year students and he has stepped up as the leader and voice of that group.

He's not one of those people that will very loudly and enthusiastically welcome you to the hall and try to shake every parent's hand. With this being said, he's very dependable, very trustworthy, and has a lot of passion potential. ","I feel like Robert would excel as a peer Leader more than as a RA. With his set of skills he is one that can create a sense of home. I have no doubt that Robert is more than capable of handling anything first year students may have, be it new friendships, academic aid, or even more psychological issues such as homesickness. ","I believe that Robert would make a great student staff member since he has expressed his interest in being a peer Leader very early on during the first semester. He is not one that will do it just for the money and I know he'd be a student staff member even if it didn't pay. He's asked me for advice, tips, and what to do during specific situations.

He is more than friendly and approachable; he takes the time to listen to others, and is often extremely reflective and profound.  He also comes from a unique cultural background, which I believe would be an invaluable resource for many residents.  Outside of the residence hall, Rodrigo is active across campus in a variety of clubs and activities (i.e. GT Archery Club), which I see as an indication of his willingness to become involved in the community as a whole.  ","Despite being involved in myriad activities and clubs, I would describe Rodrigoâ€™s personality as initially reserved.  He is far less outgoing in his day to day countenance than the average SSM, which can be seen in several different lights.  This reserved nature could potentially be positive when establishing a connection with more introverted residents.  On the opposite side of that coin, this kind of personality may not click with other residents.  I believe that given the training and time to flourish as an SSM, especially with regard to developing strong relationships with residents, this concern would be minuscule if any longer relevant. ","As I mentioned before, I can see Rodrigo reaching out and connecting with those who might feel lonely or isolated as they enter the Housing experience.  Although I could see this working well for an RA who would be dealing with upperclassmen that might tend to keep to themselves, I believe that Rodrigo would be, as I said earlier, an invaluable resource to residents just entering Georgia Tech, coming from a wide variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds.  Even with the large differences between first-year and upperclass communities, I can honestly say that Rodrigoâ€™s overall persona would be a great fit for either community, with a slight lean towards the Freshman Experience.","There is no doubt in my mind that Rodrigo would make an excellent SSM.  He is compassionate, understanding, and ready to help out at the drop of a hat.  Given his strong academic performance and involvement in extracurriculars, I believe that he would have no problem transitioning into the position.  Furthermore, were Rodrigo hired as an SSM, I am confident that he would provide a quality experience for residents of GT Housing.","There are no significant concerns to note here, other than the fact that Rodrigo is an excellent candidate for an SSM position.",Good,Excellent,Average,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Good,Yes,"As I said on the previous page, any concerns related to this candidate would be more than resolved with training and exposure to SSM culture."

As part of his role in this activity, he organised a school wide competition to raise money and organised the resultant trips for two children in need. All in all, Rodrigo is a dedicated and mature student with an excellent sense of humour. He is organized, polite and helpful, and has a good relationship with both the staff and his peers.

His charisma is noted by his peers and professors, noting that he serves as a natural leader that people enjoy following. His positivity  serves him well, as he pushes groups in which he works towards a successful endpoint. Furthermore, his ability to communicate with others goes well beyond the ability of many first year students. Ryan has never struggled to form any kind of community within his floor or his building.","Ryan's two main areas of development are impulse and perspective. In my experience with Ryan, he makes excellent choices in any circumstance where he takes the time to think things out, but occasionally (rarely) his impulsive decisions remind him of the importance of thinking before you act. Secondly, Ryan can improve on persepctive. When Ryan is faced with a personal problem, he has a slight tendency to view the problem worse than it is. At times it takes others reminding him that it is not really that bad. Perhaps it allows him to better prioritize his time. It seems to have worked for him thus far.","Ryan would be most successful with first year students, particularly an LLC. Ryan has a natural ability to strengthen groups and impact communities. I have no doubt that he would be successful in any community, but I believe that working in an LLC would maximize his strengths.","Yes, I strongly believe that Ryan will make an excellent staff member. I've had the privilege to work with Ryan and other Grand Challengers this year and have had the opportunity to see him handle situations in the same manner that student staff members would handle them.

Summer Honors is a two-week residential academics and leadership program for talented teens in the southeast. Sally is charming, kind, graceful, athletic. She’s energetic. Underneath a calm and confident exterior is a motivated and driven competitor. Early on during our two weeks of camp we could see Sally emerging as one of our most influential campers. Others gravitate to her. In a crowd, she’s not the obvious center of attention. She quietly influences others by developing relationships. People are drawn to her – they watch her and want to be like her. She welcomes everyone into her network offering kind words, funny quips and friendly advice. She leads by example, giving her all for the event and her team, and she leads by serving others with encouraging words, assistance and strong effort.","I will offer some evaluations that we made regarding Sally during Summer Honors: Displayed a great attitude throughout the entire camp. She showed that she was very adaptable, I never saw her with the same person or group of people during the day.  She was always with somebody different and having a great time with them. Sally definitely has potential [for] leadership. Her team naturally looks to her for guidance. In one activity that she was not able to participate in, she continued to cheer her team on from the sidelines. Sally is a leader. She is really strong in her faith, and is helping lead the girls in a bible study with Allyssa.  She is a social butterfly! I love how she is always hanging out with a different group.		 Sally had a really upbeat attitude every time I was around her.","Sally, at age 17 when she attended Summer Honors, was already far more mature and capable than all but the very top students we've had at Summer Honors during that last 10 years (over 400 students). I believe she simply needs some experience as an SSM to become a very important part of the leadership team.","Sally, given her age, would probably best be placed with first-year. She is very adaptable and reaches out to everyone.","Yes. I have worked with dozens of UNG RA's and campus leaders during my 10 years as director of Summer Honors. I believe Sally has the character required. She's personable, able to connect with almost any personality and type of person.","I wish Sally had matriculated at UNG. However, I wish her all the best. Sally impressed me. She is one of the finest students we have had attend Summer Honors since 2005 when I became director. I recommend her wholeheartedly.",Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,Sally is unique in the history of Summer Honors. She won both our 2014 Leadership Award and our 2014 Most Outstanding Student Award. (I made a mistake earlier and said she won the Character Award. She would have if she hadn't won so many of our top awards already.)

I have interacted with her in the Grand Challenges class, and also helped to advise her in a project she is working on with Engineers for a Sustainable World. ",Samantha is a very sincere person.  She is easy to talk to and takes the time to invest in people.  She is also a very motivated person who will go the extra mile for something is passionate about. ,Samantha perhaps needs to project a little more in talking to larger groups.  I feel like her experience as a PL would help her develop this leadership trait. ,"I think that at this point she would work the best with Grand Challenges Freshman.  She would be a sophomore during this time, and she would have the shared experience of being a Grand Challenges student herself.  I think that she can work with with both introverts and extroverts.  She might not work quite as well with aggressive personalities that are overly confrontational.  ",I think that she would be a GREAT Peer Leader for the Grand Challenges students.   She is a natural leader and a great role model for the students. ,"Samantha speaks several languages and has relatives in the US and in Sweden.  She has also lived in Brazil.

She is kind, has a great sense of humor, and is friends with almost everyone in the building.  Her passion, wit, and strong values will take her far in this position.","This is a really difficult question to answer.  One area of development may be the program planning.  I think Samantha will do a great job at this based on her character traits, but, to my knowledge, she hasn't had the opportunity to do this yet.  I think planning programs for your first time is inevitably a learning experience, so this would be an area of development for her.","I think Sammi would be most successful working with first year students.  I could see her in an environment where she is able to serve as a mentor to younger students.  I think she would do great with upperclassmen as well, but I think she would be more happy and more passionate about her job if she was a PL.","I think Samantha would be a great SSM.  She is one of the most responsible and mature girls on my floor.  Her peers look up to her as a friend and mentor.  She is known for her kindness, love of people, and strong work ethic,  ",I think Sammi would be a great asset to any staff.

We interact with each other daily and spend a lot of time together in our building. ,"Sam is by far the most involved resident I had this semester. She has a great energy, she's always up for any event or outing, she talks to everyone and is a very positive  and combinative girl.","She is very outgoing and might need to work on filtering what she says to everyone. She swears quite a bit, and as a PL that will need to decrease a lot. Just making sure she keeps in mind what kind of influence she might be having in those around her. I am sure that given that responsibility, she will work on this.","Sam would work well with first-years because she is very outgoing and fun, so I think she'd be followed to all the events and make the residents very excited! She is also very loud sometimes, so I would not recommend her to work with Honor's or the buildings where they have classrooms. She will get everyone involved and bonding in a lounge somewhere and it might not me adequate for those types of residence halls.","Yes. Like mentioned, Sam is very outgoing, fun and involved in her community. She is the one person I go to first if I need a volunteer, if I hear about some audition or try outs, because I know she will consider and most likely get involved. She knows many people around BSH area, PLs and residents, and everyone knows her around. ","The only thing she would have to work on is her language use, and what she says to others. She is never rude, nothing like that. She is just very open about her personal life and that might need to be kept more personal once she is a SSM, as an example  and role model for her residents.

She regularly encourages other staff and works very hard to ensure that the children in her care are happy and healthy.,Sam gives 110% which is great but that does mean she is constantly on the go. We've talked about her taking time off for herself and making sure she is taking care of herself. to avoid burn out.,Sam works well with a variety of people and is adaptable so I believe she will do well with most personalities. Since she is still young herself I would imagine working with first-years may be easier for her than upper-class students. ,"Yes, she is a great people person and is very amiable. She is an asset to our camp community because of her ability to put the children first and I believe she would do the same with the people she is working with at the college.",,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Yes,"Sam is competent, enthusiastic and willing to learn.

Even as a first-year resident, he has become a leader on the floor, in terms of coming up with unique, engaging ways of bringing the floor together, as well as by consistently demonstrating a willingness to put in immense personal effort towards making these community builders a reality. Sam is also extremely well liked by his peers, and is trusted as a confidant and friend. Finally, as evidenced by the way he acted during a situation with his roommate, he is strong-willed enough to want to address a conflict, tactful enough to want to find the least destructive way to approach it, and mature enough to ask me for help. ","I see Sam as the type of potential SSM who would excel in programming for residents, especially casual, floor-centric events. However, I feel as though he could further develop his skills with regards to encouraging residents to help him put on these events, rather than simply doing all the work himself.","Sam would be most successful with first-years. He has a very friendly, outgoing, and parental personality, and I feel as though he would be well suited to working with the generally energetic, guidance-seeking personalities of first-years rather than the typically more independent upperclassmen or grad family.","I would wholeheartedly recommend Sam to be an SSM. Oftentimes, I feel as though with the energy, positivity, and community that he brings to the floor, he is already an acting Peer Leader although he may not have been officially hired by the department. He provides that sort of presence to the floor already, and I would be excited to see the great things he does as an employed SSM.",No additional information.,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Yes,No additional comments concerns.

Gaining confidence in his ability to diffuse those situations would be beneficial. ",I feel Sam would be most successful working with first and second year students. I have observed Sam working well with people of all ages and people with disabilities. He is sensitive to those who need encouragement to socialize and participate in activities. I would think that overly aggressive abrasive people would be most difficult for Sam to work well with.  ,"I believe that Sam Nelson is a good candidate for an SSM position as he is hard working, honest, and treats others with respect and fairness.

She is very creative in her thoughts and always works to keep everyone on the same page. She usually forms the basis of a pyramid in a team thus being highly reliable. These strengths will make her stand out as an SSM who is able to create a happy diverse community on her floor making sure not to leave anyone behind and transferring these skills while working with the staff team as well.","The applicant will develop most in her adapting herself and her ideas to suit the needs of her residents. She might start off with a set idea, but I believe with time she will recognize how to best recognize the needs of her residents and use that to her advantage.","She will be most successful with first year residents. She works most well with people who are self-motivated, creative and enthusiastic. She works least well with people who she can't relate to for example are overly competitive or power hungry.",I believe the candidate will make a great SSM because of her extrovert personality type that is always open to exploring new ideas. She also always desires to give back to the GT community from all that she has learned - a very good example of this is her dedication to the TEDx organization where in she motivate young student leaders to share their experiences.

Being a student athlete means that you spend a lot of time with your teammates. Having the opportunity to work with different groups on campus and individuals from all different backgrounds will only strengthen her leadership qualities mentioned above. ,"While I have no doubt Sarah would be a good fit for any age group, I believe Sarah would work best with first-years over other age groups. I believe this because she exhibits a lot of patience when interacting with our fan base, particularly children. She is also very understanding, and I believe she would set a great example for new students entering the college world. ",Absolutely. The summary above about what it means to be a SSM encompasses a lot of the qualities we ask of our cheerleaders. We chose Sarah to be a part of our program because we believe she exhibits all of these qualities. ,"I would like to add that Sarah is from Florida, which means her family is far away. Her teammates have been paramount in her experience at Tech by making her feel like she has a family at school. I know being a SSM will increase these feelings for her and will in turn enhance her experience at Georgia Tech. ",Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Yes,No

She is a person that others look to based on her experience and background. She is optimistic and is focused on getting the task completed but also completed correctly. She's an extrovert and has a wonderful sense of humor. ,Delegating Tasks- Sarah is a natural leader but needs to develop her skills when it comes to breaking down roles and spreading them evenly among a group (when needed). She is the type of student who will complete the assignment and pick up the slack when other students drift away.  Learning to delegate in group situations will serve her well as a student and in the workforce. ,"Sarah works with many different personalities in a successful manner while in my classroom. I contribute this ability to her being from Brooklyn and exposed to different cultures, personalities, backgrounds, etc. Sarah fits into many social situations and adapts well to groups of students as well as individuals.

Sarah is also willing to try new things, such as Hapkido, simply to check it out. And once she finds something that she enjoys, she sticks to it. This level of dedication is also essential to the SSM position. ","This candidate could work on her expressed compassion. Sometimes she can come off as harsh, but once you actually know her, you understand that she means well. I think that this initially could come off as not being approachable to potential residents that are shy. She could also develop her active listening abilities. I believe that she can work on listening and retaining what people say to her. She does this for some people, but not necessarily everyone that she talks to.","This candidate would be most successful with upperclass students. She would work best with people that are introverted, involved, and self-motivated. She would not work well with overly passive people or people that constantly unrealistic.

I think that the experience as a potential SSM will only develop these strengths even more through event planning, advising, encouraging, and leading other students.",I expect that Shadman can relate easily with mostly first-years due to their ages being mostly similar but I don't see any complications between him and upperclass students.  I believe this because he seems much more mature than most first-years that I've known.  Shadman has a good blend of a serious down-to-business attitude and a easy-going humor.

I am her Peer Leader, and we are also involved in the same student organization (SCPC).","Shamsya is one of the most organized, driven, and responsible person I know.  She is also one of the few people I've met at Tech that never procrastinates, and always gets assignments done before a deadline.  If she is given something to do, she will always get it done promptly, with a high quality at work.  She pairs her determination with a kind heart which makes her a force to be reckoned with.","Coming into college, Shamsya was not aware of the lifestyle many college students pursue.  She is the type of person that leads her life with a strong moral compass, she has never even cussed in her life.  By living her life by such strong moral convictions, I've seen some of her peers shy away from speaking with her or being her friend.  I think an area of development for her will be learning how to be more approachable and relatable.","I think Shamsya would be most successful as a peer leader.  If she were an RA, I'm afraid she may come off as too timid if she had to deal with a serious conduct situation.  Being older than her residents might give her added self confidence and the natural authority age brings to handle a similar situation.","I think Shamsya would make a good SSM, however I think she has a lot of room to mature in terms of social interactions and self confidence.

He was involved with many academic, extracurricular and leadership organizations and was incredibly respected by both peers and faculty alike.  ","Shan is well-rounded so his areas of development are few in my opinion.  I think that he may take to heart if someone is in crisis or has needs that may be out of his control.  I know that it bothers him to not be able to resolve a situation and he may tend to dwell on this.  However, I am confident that Shan would know to get a person in crisis to the right help and support group and therefore would help in a positive way.   A position such as this would benefit him by forcing him to work with compassion and diligence while learning to compartmentalize and 'let go' when the situation is passed on if need be.  It could also reinforce that his natural empathetic nature is a wonderful trait to have.","Truthfully, Shan works well with many different types of people.  I feel that he would be able to relate with and help to guide a wide variety of residents.  He is empathetic and patient with those who need it, he is energetic and enthusiastic when the situation calls for it, and he can take charge and make a stand when needed.  Shan can work with both adults and peers and is able to relate to them in equal ways.  I honestly have never heard anyone who has had an issue with him- he just seems to get along with everyone.  The only people that I have ever seen him take issue with are those who are negative and or abusive to others and even then, he was able to address them in a respectful but firm way to work toward altering the offensive behavior.   Therefore, I truly feel that Shan would be able to handle the situations and different personalities that this position would require him to deal with and lead.","Shan understands hard work and organization and comprehends the need to balance policies and regulations with personalization, humor and a genuine attitude.  He is quick with a smile, an idea, a helping hand and a solution.  Working with him and watching him grow into the young man that he is today is proof that he would be a great SSM.  He knows how to relate to the 'outcast' as well as the 'in crowd' and has real world experiences and insights that set him apart from the norm.  He is wise and kind beyond his years and his intelligence and humor make him both likable and approachable.  Shan is dedicated, loyal and a true humanitarian who loves to serve others.  He is compelling and draws people in so that they feel a connection.  This charisma backed by genuine character and integrity make Shan an exceptional choice for this position.","I am convinced that Shan Suen would be an incredible asset to the PL or SSM program.  Seeing him be an officer, a leader, STAR Student, a performer, musician and scholar throughout high school while he balanced his family, friends and faith is a testament to his unique and diverse interests and character.  Shan would be an extraordinary benefit to this program and I hope that you will strongly consider him. ",Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,Shan Suen embodies the attributes above.  I cannot speak highly enough about his exceptional traits and skills.

He has a strong ability to interact and bond with individuals and groups through differing techniques like, reflective listening, strong body language, and objective listening. He has the ability to both control and guide conversations to help others and himself through various situations, including those that are emergent and those that are relaxed.","As an SSM, Shan would need to work on his time-management skills. Often he swamps himself with classes and extracurriculars often leading to late nights and stress. He will need to learn how to better manage his time and organize his priorities so that he dedicates the appropriate amount of time to everything and prevents stress and overload.","Shan would be most successful with first-year students. He has a very enthusiastic and passionate personality. He loves to interact with others and create deep, meaningful relationships with individuals, which would work best with first-year students. His personality would work best with those that mirror his energy and commitment. He would work least well with those who prefer to stay to themselves and are much more reserved.","I believe Shan would make a great SSM. He loves interacting and being around others.

We are both members of the Catholic Student Organization and have become friends through our involvement in that organization.,"Shannon possesses many strengths that would make her a great candidate for the SSM position. First, she is extremely motivated and well-organized. If she were hired for this position, she would make it a priority of hers to approach her job with the utmost care and give it the attention that is necessary and it deserves. Second, she has a very outgoing personality and has many experiences working with diverse groups of people.  This will be a valuable trait for the SSM position because it means that Shannon will possess the qualities necessary to work well with other staff members and to reach out to and build meaningful relationships with her residents.","I think Shannon encompasses many of the things that the Department of Housing looks for and values in an SSM. She has had many experiences and has adopted and outlook that would make her an excellent addition to any housing staff. If there were areas Shannon could work on to develop her strengths as an SSM, I would suggest she make sure that not all residents will respond in the same way to outgoing behavior, so sometimes you need to be engaging, but also reserved when trying to develop relationships with residents who tend to be shy.","I think Shannon's personality type as I've described above would be most well-suited for the Peer Leader position in the Freshman Experience. A Peer Leader is someone who needs to be a role model in his or her community, someone who is able to help Freshmen get acclimated to Georgia Tech and build up a strong community and or close personal bonds among residents and student staff. Because of Shannon's bubbly personality, outgoing persona, and caring nature, I think this will be an excellent fit for the Freshman Experience.","In summary, I believe that Shannon would make a great SSM, especially a PL. Having worked with Shannon on numerous functions for the Catholic Student Organization and having observed her own presentations and work, she really dedicates a lot of heart and time to that which she cares about, and I know the SSM position is very meaningful to her. Her qualities and attributes are definitely those which will direct Freshmen or any residents for that matter towards having a fruitful and enjoyable dorm and college experience.",,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Yes,"In the interview, I would note that Shannon presents herself very well.

She serves others very well and enjoys being around people. She also gets down to business when she needs to do so. Her personality and work ethic are both desirable for potential SSMs. She would be a great example to her residents and maintain her responsibilities well. She also is very good at creating community with those around her and took a lead in this on her freshman hall.","She is very involved on campus and is very busy. However, the things she commits to she does fully.  She also has difficulty empathizing with certain situations, but this does not keep her from showing love and care to the people around her. ","This applicant would work well in either position, but I believe her genuinely upbeat personality and positive outlook would make her an excellent PL. Her organization and focus would give her the ability to work with upperclassmen also, but I believe some incoming freshmen would be missing out by not having her as their PL.","Absolutely. This candidate was the leader of the hall her Freshman year. She did not have any official role or title, but she was the creator of a community in the hall that is still close today. She and I became good friends throughout the year because she spent so much time serving other residents and getting to know them; she stayed behind after her finals were done just to make dinner and bake cookies for those who still had finals left. Not only does she have an incredibly kind hart, but she is on top of her stuff. She is organized and is a good student. She is very self-motivated and driven.

I have known her as long as we've been in school (~3 months). ,"Shekinah is very mature and well respected in the hall. I remember when a resident was making derogatory comments during a hall event about a demographic that she was included in, she was incredibly calm and clear in her response to the comment. She is interested in social justice, so she would bring a wealth of knowledge about how to have those conversations tactfully and take advantage of teaching moments.   Moreover, Shekinah is always smiling when I see her and I hear from her academic advisor and professor (we're both in the School of Public Policy) that she has been a pleasure to have in class and works diligently on assignments. I have not observed her ability to work with others first-hand, but I imagine she would be fantastic by the way she is always spending time and working on assignments with other people in the hall and in the library. Any SSM would be lucky to have her as their colleague.   With regard to time management, I predict that she would climb the learning curve quickly. She has had no trouble making time to study for her classes, and the one time I saw her stressed about classes, she talked through her problems calmly and described what she was going to do to deal with the situation. I highly doubt she would ever get so stressed out from her duties as an SSM that she would treat her residents badly or ignore them. Her residents would learn a lot from how she manages stress. ","As far as I know, Shekinah is not involved in many extracurriculars or communities outside of the Grand Challenges program. Because of that, she may not be aware of the opportunities out there for students, as well as the resources on campus should someone need help. However, this gap in knowledge will be addressed as she gets more involved in future semesters and attends Housing training. ","I can confidently say that Shekinah has the maturity and grace to be successful with any age group. She would be calming force around energetic or high-strung personalities. She would be an empathetic, positive energy around introverted and shy personalities. ","Yes, Shekinah would be a fantastic SSM! Though I have only known her for a few short months, she has never failed to impress me with her emotional intelligence (e.g. ability to identify how she's feeling, acknowledge it, and articulate how she'll move forward) and social intelligence (e.g. recognizing social cues, helping others feel more comfortable). She is also well respected by faculty and staff already, so a hall director would have no trouble coaching her and feeling comfortable giving her feedback.

He lends an empathetic ear when he hears about other people's challenges. Sheng is also diplomatic, he is not quick to judgement. He takes his time to hear both sides of a situation and does not rush to judgement. (I believe that comes from his many years of working in science labs!) Sheng has moved many times in his life. He has moved to a new country and new states. He understands what it's like to be the new kid in the new place and I believe he is best suited in helping students transitioning from high school to the university. ",Throughout high school Sheng has had to balance academics with extra curricular activities. Each year he  became more successful at balancing his obligations.  ,"I think Sheng would probably work best with first year students. Sheng moved to the United States in 5th grade from China. He moved from Missouri to Cleveland in 7th grade, and this past year he came to Georgia Tech. Because Sheng has had to move to a variety of places in his life, he understands transition. He would be helpful to students who have not had the experience of moving away from home before. Sheng would work well with any type of student. His easy-going personality and his vast knowledge of popular culture makes him a good fit with all.","I would highly recommend Sheng for the SSM position. In my past 17 years of teaching, there are few students that have made such a lasting impression on my career as Sheng. I enjoy talking to Sheng, we have conversations about Lebron James, Elon Musk, Chairman Mao. He's shown me the best way to pick fresh ginger and a grocery store. This makes me know that he can have a conversation with anyone about anything! That's a good quality to have when you a SSM. Sheng is very level headed, I've never seen him upset or emotional. ( When he was in 8th grade one of the apartments in his building caught on fire accidentally. The fire spread to his family's apartment and his family lost everything. Sheng came to school the next day and was very calm in the midst of all the chaos. He spoke to me about situation briefly, and kept his composure. I never had so much respect for a 14 year old boy.  Georgia Tech needs a SSM that can stay level headed. With so many tragedies happening at universities and schools today, we need people like Sheng.

Whether it is inside or outside the classroom, she carries a truly motivational energy, wanting to do her best in whatever situation she is put in.  Furthermore, her energy is not one that is self-centered but instead inspiring, making her energy contagious to those around her. As someone who is older than Shivani and has given her previous guidance, I still look up to her when it comes to her energy. ","One area of development for Shivani as a potential SSM is her stern mentality. She takes all words and actions with a serious mindset, so something that one may say as a joke or no malicious intent can at times upset or offend Shivani. However, I don't think this is a crucial area of development and since it's a weakness she's admitted to before as well, I have confidence she will be able to overcome this. ","Though I believe she will be successful with any type of resident, I think she will be appreciated the most among first year students. Her open-mindedness and willing to help others would be greatly useful to first year students who are making the transition from high school to college, in which many problems can arise. Whether it is conflict between roommates, academic stress, or homesickness, Shivani has always been proficient at working with all types of people.

","Shruti is, from what I've gathered in my limited time knowing her, a little shy and timid, so she might need to work on being outgoing and enthusiastic.","I think Shruti would be good with first years. She can make an impact on them while coming out of her own shell and being more comfortable as a leader. Freshmen tend to need their PLs more than upperclassmen need their RAs, so I think that she would be well-challenged in that role. I do not know how much of an impact or personal growth she would experience as an RA. Because she is new, and therefore a little shy, she could help those in similar situations next year as a PL.","I think that Shruti has good intentions and is a very kind and caring person. Again, because I do not know her extensively, I am forced to speculate on her personality.  I think that if she is put in the right situation, namely as a PL and with freshmen who she would have to interact with very often, she would eventually become very open and helpful towards them. So I think she, after becoming more accustomed to Georgia Tech, would make a good PL but an average RA.","She was proactive in seeking out the application for this position within 3 days of transferring to Georgia Tech, so I think it shows initiative on her part and a deliberate wish to become more involved on campus.",Average,Not Applicable,Average,Good,Good,Not Applicable,Average,Average,Not Applicable,Not Applicable,"Yes, but with reservations","The in-person interview would be much more reflective of Shruti's strengths and weaknesses than my 3 days of experience with her, therefore, my recommendation is not a concrete representation of her personality and capability."

On my floor, he was definitely a team player, but he was not always a leader. By becoming an SSM, I think his leadership skills will flourish. ","Because of his age, I think Shuv would be stronger working with upperclass students. He was not living on campus during his sophomore year because he was interning; however, he is interested in working for housing in the upcoming year. Although he is comfortable with and passionate about freshmen activities and involvement because of his freshman year on my floor, I think working with upperclassmen would be a good challenge for him.

Shuvajit isn't the person to hold someones hands 100% of the time.  He is smart and responsible person.  Not a baby sitter.,"Yes.  For all the reasons already stated.  Has a good judgment.  Never a 'can't do' attitude but rather a 'this won't work BUT here is an option' type person.  In life you want a person who gives solutions to a problem, not just state the problem and keep talking about it.","Shuvajit showed maturity at a level you don't most often see with a person his age.  Education can be learned and taught in school.  Human interaction, social communication, and professionalism is from natural behavior and experience.  He is far ahead in this area.  Add his intelligence to the mix and you have a candidate whom any employer would want.",Excellent,Excellent,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Yes,Think I have said enough.

1 5 2016  9:37:00 PM,Siddhart Jacob Varughese,Jouni Peppanen,Resident Advisor,jouni.peppanen@gmail.com,RA PL Recommendation,Resident Advisor or Peer Leader,N A,Siddhart Jacob Varughese has been a resident of mine at Tenth & Home Building C since the beginning of Fall semester 2015. I have also been in the Tenth & Home   GLC flag football and soccer teams with him during the Fall semester 2015.,"First, I think that Siddhart has great interpersonal skills making it very easy for him to meet new people from diverse backgrounds as well as to have meaningful conversations and make close connections with them. In several occasions including several events that I have organized, Siddhart has naturally stepped up to become the center lead of the conversation in a very positive way. I think that this natural talent of Siddhart can bring him far in life and would allow him to build a tight community among his residents as an RA. Second, throughout the time that I have known Siddhart, he has proven his strong enthusiasm towards the residence life by actively participating in all events and moreover, by many times volunteering to help in the event organization. Furthermore, Siddhart has been a core member of the Tenth & Home and GLC flag football and soccer teams by participating at all the practices and games, by encouraging everyone else to come to the practices, by taking leadership in organizing extra practices, and by going to the Hall Council to get funds for the sport-team. Third, based on what I know of Siddhartâ€™s background, I think that he would be an excellent role model for his residents as an RA. Siddhart has not only been extremely successful in academics but also has shown leadership in a large variety of extracurricular activities. I am confident that he would encourage and support his residents to do the same. ",I am sure that Siddhart could learn a great deal from the RA position but I donâ€™t see him having any areas that would need to be developed in order for him to be a successful RA.,"I think that Siddhart would be the best RA for graduate students (Tenth & Home or GLC) since he is a graduate student himself. However, due to his great interpersonal skills and age, I am sure that Siddhart would be equally successful also with undergrads.",Definitely. Please see my reply to question 9.,Please read my comprehensive reply to question 9.,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,Please read my comprehensive reply to question 9. I believe that it highlights my view of the candidate.
1 3 2016  10:19:00 PM,Siddhi Shah,Timothy W Sowers,Graduate Research Assistant,timothy.w.sowers@gmail.com,Non Residence Life Staff Recommendation,Current or Former Supervisor,N A,Siddhi has worked for me as an undergraduate research assistant since the beginning of the summer of 2015.  ,"Siddhi has three main strengths as a potential SSM.  Siddhiâ€™s agreeableness and conscientiousness are her strongest attributes.   Sheâ€™s immediately likable and her humble demeanor makes her easily approachable.  This would be an asset in her position as an SSM.  It is easy to imagine a student in need of support feeling like s he could come to Siddhi for advice.  Siddhi is also conscientious about her work.  She has met all deadlines associated with our project and has shown a willingness to stay late in the lab when necessary.  In addition, if she has time conflicts due to other campus events she communicates them early and is responsible about coming in at a different time to complete her work.  Iâ€™d imagine that this is a necessary skill for SSMs, who would have to juggle multiple activities while on campus.  Second, Siddhi has significant experience in student groups on campus.  This would make her effective in two ways.  First, she would be able to relate more easily to a wider variety of students on campus.  Lastly, her experience as the A-town Showdown Events Chair and a Georgia Tech Student Health Services Ambassador means she already has experience organizing events.  No doubt this experience will prove useful in building community among the group of students with whom she is assigned.  Overall, I think Siddhiâ€™s character and personality, her diverse interests on campus, and her experience organizing events make Siddhi an excellent candidate as an SSM.  ","I think the most difficult aspect of being an SSM for Siddhi will be enforcing university policy.  I know when I was an RA at my undergraduate university, this was difficult for most people, myself included.  I could see the confrontational nature of these instances being difficult for her.  No doubt, any training you provide would help her with this, and the instances would ultimately be a growing experience for Siddhi.  ","In the context of the lab, Iâ€™ve seen Siddhi work mostly with one other undergraduate student and myself.  In both cases, the interaction has been positive and effective.  From this, I can conclude that Siddhi would be effective working with upperclassman her age or older.  I think Siddhi would be effective working with any personality type.  There isnâ€™t any single set of personalities that I think she wouldnâ€™t work well with.  The only time I could see her having trouble is if any resident of hers is purposefully being difficult.  ","Yes.  I believe Siddhiâ€™s strengths make her an ideal candidate as an SSM.  Her agreeableness and conscientiousness, her diverse interests on campus, and event organizing experience are all strong assets.  They would make her effective at building quality relationships with other students on campus.  They would also make her a reliable employee.  ","I worked as a resident assistant, the equivalent of an SSM, during my junior and senior years of undergraduate work at Trinity University (San Antonio, TX).  Having that experience gives me insight into the requirements of the SSM job, and how well Siddhi would perform at it.  I believe this is information you would want to consider when evaluating my recommendation.  ",Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,Another trait I havenâ€™t mentioned that should be considered is her academic record.  She has a strong GPA at Georgia Tech and her past performance in high school was similarly strong.  I have no doubt sheâ€™d be capable of handling her responsibilities as an SSM while concurrently meeting her academic and other on campus responsibilities.

We interacted through dance which can be anywhere from 7 hours a week to 24 hours a week depending on the competitions we attend. ,"I feel that Siddhi would make a great addition to the student staff because she has the determination and creativity for the job. She is willing to build a community and learn the common interests between her residents. She is a responsible individual that is  concerned with safety and the professional aspect that this job requires. Based off my interaction with her, it is evident that when she is given a role or responsibility, she sees it through 100%. ","Siddhi has great interpersonal skills and leadership potential. However, when it comes to developing further potential she sometimes displays signs of less maturity(in a fun character type of way) and lower motivation. She has the voice to show self confidence but sometimes she needs the extra motivation to successfully complete her task. These are things she can improve upon and things that will become apparent through SSM training. ",Siddhi would be great as an RA who deals with upperclass students.  She has the skillets and the campus experience to help with upperclassmen especially in terms of providing resources for jobs or handling situations involving things like stress. These are all factors we learn during training but Siddhi already has such experience which is invaluable. Siddhi is a people pleaser and will do whatever she can to help others. Her creativity could be used to find ways to bring upperclass residents out which is something that most RAs struggle with. She works better with outgoing and charismatic people but she can adapt quickly to anyone especially those in her community who she would be interacting with more frequently. ,"Yes, I feel that Siddhi would make a good addition because she makes people comfortable when talking to her. She also makes an effort to get to know others. She has the ability to manage as a leader and delegate efficiently as I have seen her do in the past.",Siddhi is one of the hardest working people I know. I don't doubt that her values and personality won't transfer over if she is to become a SSM. ,Good,Average,Excellent,Average,Good,Excellent,Good,Good,Good,Good,Yes,Siddhi has the creativity and the knowledge to be a great resource to her residents. She would always be interactive and find ways to get everyone involved but still provide for them in any means necessary.

","Like many young people at Tech, Sidney will further hone her leadership skills. She already has inherent fundamentals - interpersonal skills, strength and courage - and when she emerges as an SSM she will be able to put those into a leadership role and really make an impact. ","Peers and first years. Many of her peers look up to her for the qualities I mentioned above. She is very social and personable and could see her greatly benefit first-years in particular, getting them to draw out of their shells. However, I see through cheerleading that Sidney can connect with anyone - the 2 year old fan or the 90-year old GT donor! ","Absolutely. Sidney is extremely outgoing and social, and is used to collaborating and being part of a team with Georgia Tech Cheerleading. She is already highly visible as a cheerleader which could add to role. She is well-suited for leadership with strong interpersonal skills.

We are also on the Georgia Tech Cheerleading Team together.,"As an SSM, we must have the ability to cater to all types of people. Sidney has the ability not only to talk and be friendly with many different groups of people, but she tends to befriend them for long term relationships. I feel this is the most important aspect to being a PL.",Time management skills will be needed in terms of focusing appropriate time to academics. ,"I would suggest Sidney work with first year students. Being a Freshman now, this will allow her an easier environment to work in.","I do believe Sidney would make a good SSM. The personality of every SSM I know is matched by Sidney.

Through her kind-hearted spirit and approachability, Ilinca quickly built strong relationships with other members of the community. She shows a genuine interest in learning about her peers and remembers specific details about individuals in the community. Ilinca has a remarkable understanding of diversity, and uses her personal experiences to empathize with others.  In addition to Ilinca’s magnanimous personality, she also exhibits focus and drive in her academic studies and extracurricular activities. Ilinca’s ultimate goals are to attend medical school after college and serve the Georgia Tech and Atlanta communities during her time at Tech. She accompanied the Georgia Tech choir at the Catholic Center with piano, she works in a research lab on campus, and she enjoys community service. Ilinca has the perfect combination of work ethic and compassion to collaborate with other SSMs on a staff and develop a close community as an SSM.","Because of Ilinca’s gentle personality, she at first seems quiet and timid. However, in one semester, I have seen Ilinca grow and become one of the most active members of the community. The SSM position would help Ilinca become even more comfortable on campus and in large group settings. I have no doubt that Ilinca would serve her community well and that the SSM position would help her achieve her full leadership potential.","Ilinca would be successful serving either first-year residents or upperclassmen, but she would be more successful in a community with mostly first-year students. First-year students generally require an SSM that is approachable, attentive, and empathetic like Ilinca to help them transition to college life. Ilinca always finds a way to transform a stressful moment into a positive experience and that would help first-year students through their difficult exams and moments of personal struggle.  Ilinca enjoys collaborating on projects and initiatives and works well with others, especially those who share her uplifting spirit and willingness to help others. Ilinca might work less effectively with headstrong individuals who have unwavering opinions, but she would find a polite way to speak her mind and accomplish goals in a group with those individuals.","Ilinca would be an extremely successful SSM, residents would feel comfortable approaching her with questions and concerns, and her staff would thoroughly enjoy working with her. Ilinca is respectful and diligent and would be able to meet her Hall Director’s expectations. She is also friendly and everyone in the community would want to know her and share their experiences with her. Ilinca’s optimism and kindness light up any room that she is in, and her community would benefit from her bright spirit.",,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,Ilinca would be a successful SSM and I highly recommend her for the position.

As an international student, he has seamlessly adapted to American culture and is heavily involved in Georgia Tech’s culture. He makes an effort to understand how different cultures value things, and has assimilated many of the things that are difficult for others to do so, such as American humor, pastimes, etc. As his resume suggests, Soham is incredibly intelligent and is stellar in academic settings, largely in part to his incredible time management skills. On our floor, Soham is often, if not always the first person to finish assignments, usually within the first few days of their assigning. Furthermore, he actively seeks opportunities to get involved in, and has lots of experience looking for positions in organizations, and is involved around many communities on campus, such as SAA and India club. Soham also has a great balance of extroverted and introverted qualities, which allows him to connect with people of various dispositions, which I have observed firsthand in his interactions with his floormates. People enjoy being around Soham, and he enjoys group settings. He works very well individually and in group settings, as he has a good balance of contributing to discussions and listening and improving on others. ","Soham possesses a skillset that is well tailored to serving as an SSM, and working in this role will allow him to develop his communication, organization, and interaction skills. He has extensive experience in leadership roles already, and his involvement in activities such as RoboJackets and IEEE provide evidence of his ability to work in a team setting. Additionally, Soham serves on SAA’s marketing committee with me, and I am impressed by his contributions to our brainstorming sessions, his ability to organize events, and his enthusiasm when volunteering for tasks. Conversing with Soham is always a pleasure, as he is witty and inquisitive, always seeking to know more. With the training in active listening and reflective questioning, I feel that Soham would become a standout communicator, especially with his background in different cultures. ","The candidate would be successful with both first- years and upperclass residents due to the strengths discussed above. I believe that Soham would work best with first years, as his experiences in adapting to both a new country and university life would be invaluable for first year freshman experience residents.  His involvement on campus and academic excellence would give his residents a valuable resource in getting started on the right track at Georgia Tech. Furthermore, his enthusiasm and willingness to learn about culture and traditions will provide him and his residents ample opportunity for various events and escapades.  Soham would work best with other international students, particularly those from India, as he has served in that mentor role already. However, his cheerful demeanor and enthusiasm would allow him to get along with all personalities, and would make him an excellent SSM.  ","Soham will be a very successful SSM as he has the qualities necessary for it, along with being involved on campus while being excellent in the classroom. His academic excellence would encourage his residents to model themselves after him, and his involvement would encourage his residents to do so as well. His personality would allow for quick bonding which would lead to a strong community. His enthusiasm translates to him always being up for events or floor bonding activities, evidenced by our all too frequent midnight snack runs. In staff, he would provide a valuable perspective being from a different culture, which allows him to tailor events and advertising in such a way that people from different backgrounds would understand and would be made to feel welcome.

I think he feels comfortable in almost every situation, which allows him to bridge relationships together. Therefore his biggest strength is bringing people together in a comfortable social gathering.","Unfortunately his comfort in most situations often leads to either offense or insult due to a slight lack of a verbal filter.

For the Student Assistant (SA) position that Sydney held, she had to do many of the tasked listed in the above statement; organize social events, mediate conflicts between campers, help campers during class along with teach even science activities.  I can't say in strong enough words how well Sydney did and well she would do at GT.  ",Sydney's only downfall was how dedicated she was to making sure that the summer camp went well for every.  Many times some of her peer works started to back out of their responsibilities and Sydney always picked up the slack.  Because of this she started to get overworked by the end of the summer.  She needed to be able to say no to her peers that took advantage of her hard work and dedication.,"I think Sydney would work well with any resident.  She worked well at our camp with both middle high school students, her SA peers (same age), along with all of the supervisors at the camp.    The GoSciTech program had a variety of personal with many different personalities.  I think Sydney would do an excellent job working with anyone. ","Sydney would make a fantastic Peer Leader.  In the summer of 2015 her dedicated work as an SA for the GoSciTech was unequal to any other SA I had.  She worked well with others, she was one of the best and most reliable SAs that I have worked with.  Sydney has a kind and caring nature.  She likes to take care of people and truly respects everyone.  ","I wholehearedly endorse Sydney White's application for a Peer Leader at GT.  She was an excellent employee for me and I am sure that she would be the same at GT. Please feel free to contact me for more details or any other question you may have.  I would enthusiastically rehire Sydney to work for me again!  One last think.  During the last days of the GoSciTech camp.  Another SA asked Sydney to switch shifts with her, of which Sydney agreed.   During that shift we had a situation arise where Sydney ended up talking to a very very irate mother.  Sydney should not have had to talk to this mother (that was another staff members responsibtily), but she handled herself with great maturity and I was very proud of her for that.

In the past five months, I have had multiple overlaps and close work experience with Taylor. I would say I know every aspect of her academic, extracurricular, and social life particularly in detail. ","An immediate strength of Taylor is her speaking ability and outer confidence that truly reflects the her inner personality. As a PL, I believe Taylor will bring together her residents far more closely than most. Collaboration is key to how she operates. Within SGA, I have seen her organize multiple groups into order and service even as a younger member. She exudes a positivity that allows you to truly settle into her personality and trust that she is there for you as a mentor if needed.  Immediately, Taylor took action to involve herself with a diverse group of students by leading RHA as president. Her initiative and desire to make Georgia Tech a better community is quite apparent in both her words and actions. ","I believe Taylor only has one slight area of development. Her organization skills in all of her involvements could be sharpened to better utilize her time.

I believe if she were to receive this position, Taylor would be far more organized and detail oriented than she is currently. ","Taylor will most definitely work well with freshman females. While watching her interact in social environments, her immediate strength is the amiable ability to truly get to know those around her and remember their story of who they are. She will work best with enthusiastic, extroverted residents. However, I believe no personality will find Taylor offensive or overwhelming due to her genuine nature. She takes the time to truly know someone.","Yes, I believe she is an excellent candidate. Her involvement in multiple, influential extracirriculars on campus, perfect GPA, amiable personality, collaboration skills, and general to specific knowledge on multitudes of campus resources and opportunities makes her a candidate that touches all necessary bases in an in depth manner. I believe it would be a detriment to the incoming freshman class to miss out on the opportunity to have someone as outstanding as her to guide them.

I met him early in the term (within the first few days), and he has been a resident with whom I have had many interactions and have gotten to know very well.","Tyler displays many qualities and attributes that would make him a good SSM. First, he has displayed and continues to display a great interest and enthusiasm for the job, which I believe is very important when sorting through applicants. Second, he is very compassionate and inclusive. When encountering situations where residents are going through tough times or residents are more reserved, these traits become extremely useful in forging closer relationships and healthier communities.","If there were one area of development Tyler could build upon as an SSM, I would suggest he be a little more outgoing and approach everyday residential dealings with vigor. He would be an excellent communicator with more reserved residents, but the trick is also to connect with residents who are very lively and involved in the community and match their overall enthusiasm and vigor.","I think that Tyler would work well with both upperclass students and first-years. He has qualities, like being a bit more laid-back and reserved that I feel would be a better fit for upperclass students. However, he is also very much strong community oriented which is easier to achieve in a Freshman dorm.","I believe that Tyler would make a good SSM.

I see her every day in the hall and 1 evening a week additionally because of the service committee. ","Tessa would be a good role model in how she balances being on the crew team, hall council, academics and service. She is driven by a sense of duty and has been one of the most committed members of the service meeting: she has attended 90% of meetings this semester and provided good feedback at these meetings. Tessa is also supportive of her community: she submitted a bill to get cooking baking supplies for the whole floor to use after several of the girls complained about not having a set of dishware to share. Because of her involvements across campus, Tessa has the background knowledge to be a great resource about places for her residents to get involved on campus. ","Tessa looks at and uses her phone a lot, especially during large group activities. During service meetings, I have been afraid that other members may feel like she is not paying attention to them, but she always jumps right back into conversation (somehow pays attention to both) and no one has expressed concern about her phone use being a deterrence during meetings. Regardless, it may seem rude or distracting if she were to use her phone while talking to residents. ","Tessa does not have the most energetic or creative personality, so she may get worn out by expending energy and creating programs that interest upperclassmen. I would recommend first-year students for that reason, but I could see her working with upperclassmen as well. ","I believe Tessa could make a good SSM because she has a calm personality, a wide variety of interests to share, and has the good of the community in mind. She would be more successful partnered with an older SSM who could guide her and help her break bad habits like excessively using her phone.

Given the instructions and resources to succeed, Thomas will take them, execute, and get the results he is looking for. As an SSM, Thomas will be inquisitive and set high expectations for himself.  ","Thomas is eager and tends to move at a fast pace. At meals with his floormates, Thomas will eat quickly and leave very quickly, and he is not usually willing to hang out until everyone finishes and is ready to return.

He has lived there since the beginning of Fall semester. ,"Tobin cares about people. It is evident in his everyday interactions with me and with his fellow residents. In my opinion, that is the most valuable personality trait for someone in the Peer Leader or RA position. Every other necessary part of the job becomes almost effortless when a level of care like Tobin's is present in the SSM. Tobin also enjoys being involved in Hall Council and in the floor's activities. He is willing to step out of his comfort zone to have a good time with his peers. I appreciate his willingness to lend a helping hand to his peers and to his peer leaders. Tobin is a strong candidate for this position.","While Tobin is able to interact and converse well, the frequency of interaction is low. I am impressed every time I talk to him or see him in an interaction, but he is not prone to have many conversations. I would describe him as more of an introvert. Introverts can be very successful PLs, however, I believe it is challenging for them to engage residents regularly as it takes more effort and energy for that personality type. I believe Tobin could work on developing his frequency of interaction, because as a Peer Leader he will be required to be present and vocal in the community.","I believe Tobin would be a successful Peer Leader. As an RA I do not believe Tobin would succeed. Tobin is very nice and would be good at developing community and advising freshman. He would be able to confront these newer residents and be successful, but upperclassmen are more difficult to deal with and I question if Tobin could be successful confronting them. The candidate would be successful on a floor of eager, kind people. I do not know if Tobin could deal with confrontational or aggressive residents. ","I believe Tobin would be a successful Peer Leader. He reminds me of Sherwin Davoud in his conversational ability and stature. As previously stated, Tobin cares about people. In my opinion, he will be able to overcome any weaknesses he has out of sheer force of care, and it would be hard for a floor not to form strong bonds with a PL like Tobin.

He is able to take command of a situation when that kind of leadership is called for, and is eager to jump at any opportunity to make a difference by taking charge. He is a very community-oriented person, and is very adept at effectively communicating with both supervisors and peers, which I have seen firsthand as an advisor for the hall council of which he is vice president.","As a current first year student, Utkarsh has yet to experience some of the more extreme situations that an older staff member may have already seen in some way, and his scope of vision for what the general student body experiences may not be as broad as that of an older resident. However, I believe that training does a good job of acclimating people to that way of thinking, and I believe Utkarsh has the mental and emotional capacity to excel in that area with some development as well.","I believe that Utkarsh may be more successful with first-year residents, because he has been a part of a very active floor community, and has been instrumental in making it the way it is. He has experience in this area, and would know exactly what it takes to build a tight-knit community. However, given his maturity, intelligence, and strong leadership presence, I think he would also be very successful with upperclass students, if he was placed in such a position.","I believe that Utkarsh would make a good, SSM, due to his ability to act as both a resident and a staff member, and seamlessly switch between those two roles and be successful in both.",None,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Yes,None

I have gotten to know Vaish very well through conversations with her and her friends, as well as her participation in hall events.","Vaish is a natural leader.  She invests a lot of energy into her relationships with her friends, and I believe that she would be able to apply her value of strong relationships successfully to the SSM position.  I see her organize outings and events and study sessions with her friends, all without seeming overbearing.  Because of this I believe she would be excellent at developing community on her floor.  Her natural leadership style and friendliness make her highly qualified for the SSM position.","Vaish is highly confident as a leader, but I believe she would need to emphasize collaboration as an SSM.  Teamwork with staff and residents alike is crucial to success as an SSM, so Vaish would have to work on relinquishing some authority to leverage the strengths of her team.",I believe that Vaish would be most successful with upperclass students.  Vaish's maturity and confidence would allow her to work with residents and staff older than her without any problem.  I believe that Vaish works well with most personalities.,"I believe that Vaish would be an excellent SSM.  She is confident and sociable, and puts high value on relationships with others.  I believe that this would lead her to create a strong community on her floor.  Vaish is unique in that she has a friendly yet no-nonsense personality.

As NYS FBLA's Executive Vice President, Vamshi supervised 7 state vice presidents in their duties which included training them on their roles as SVP's, assisting them with developing their district meetings, providing encouragement and support in stressful situations, and evaluating their work 3 times during the school year.   He's a good listener and communicator and has an extremely strong work ethic.","I think, in general, he's a very mature young man, but there are times when he can get overly critical of certain situations and when that happens he tends to get tunnel-vision.  He needs to work on being more open-minded when those types of situations occur.    Overall, though I think he is very well-rounded with his skill-set."," Vamshi  has a strong academic, co-curricular and sports background, so  he would work well with most types of residents.  He does tend to gravitate to people who are hard-workers and who want to be involved, rather than those that just want to sit on the sidelines.  He tends to be critical of those that say they will do something and then don't do it, unless there is a mitigating circumstance.","Yes, I do.  As a local and state officer, Vamshi mentored many of his fellow FBLA members - encouraging them to participate in school and civic events, helping find the right competition to suit their specific strengths, and when someone was having a difficult time, whether in school, personally, et.c., he would offer a shoulder to lean on.  He led by example, participating in as many activities and competitions as he could while understanding his own personal limitations.","Vamshi was well-respected as a local and state officer in FBLA.  Members and adult leadership often sought out his thoughts and opinions on issues, activities, etc..  He's very much a gentleman, polite and helpful with a strong sense of right and wrong.

Throughout the semester I got to know the applicant very well through interactions in the organization and have now become very close friends.,The applicant is very good at having different types of conversations to cater to his audience and this is something I believe that will help him greatly to build that community on his floor that he aims to create. He also takes an interest in knowing about the other person and going out of the way to help them in the most pragmatical way and this is something that his residents can take from. He is also a very pragmatic and logical person so this is something that will help him sustain the professional role of a SSM and also offering credible solutions to his residents. ,The applicant will learn how to encourage residents who are in their own shell to come out and be part of and engage in the community - it is the first step in building the community that will be most difficult for him while working with introverted residents.,"This applicant will be most successful with upper class students. He also works well with people who are honest about their commitments, their ideas and feedback while working in a group.

1 11 2016  9:22:00 PM,Veda Berg,Brody Johnstone,Freshman Activities Board Advisor & College of Computing Teaching Assistant & GT1000 Team Leader,brodyjackj@gatech.edu,Non Residence Life Staff Recommendation,Other (please specify in next question),"She is a member of Freshman Activities Board, of which I am an advisor.",I have known the applicant since my sophomore year of high school in 2011. She is a year below me and we have been good friends since then. We met in our concert band class and have remained friends since then.,"Friendly and approachable' is certainly a quality that Veda exhibits and would absolutely be one of her strengths as a SSM. Since I've known Veda, she has always been a gentle and kind person who is easy to talk to and have a conversation with, even if you do not know her very well. I believe this quality would help her connect to residents that are more shy than others, which is an important role of the job. Friendships that Veda builds are always long-lasting and meaningful, with a lot of depth. This is a strength as well, as she would be willing and able to construct lasting relationships with her residents without leaving anyone out. It is worth noting that Veda acted as Section Leader for flutes in Marching Band, and thus has experience taking care of a group of people and being responsible for others. Her responsibilities included being kind and approachable as well as being firm enough to teach the band members to march properly and not 'goof' around too much, so to speak. She also planned and held get-togethers for the flutes, similar the informal social events mentioned as a responsibility of a SSM. I can vouch for Veda being very effective at this job, as I was the Drum Major of the Marching Band and my job was to preside over her (and all the sections) and make sure she was doing a good job. I never had any qualms with the way she did things, and the flutes were always the most uniform section of the band.  Additionally, Veda is excellent at conflict resolution. This was something that came up quite often in marching band, and Veda always took a mild but firm approach to solving this issue. She held enough authority that the band members new when Veda was being serious and wanted them to quit messing around, but was not so strong-handed as to give the band members a reason to dislike her. This is a hard to find quality and Veda certainly has it.","While Veda is definitely friendly and approachable, Veda can be shy at times. While I believe this will appeal to some residents who are also shy and may be able to confide in that quality, I do believe that it is an area in which Veda can improve. With her being a member of FAB, I can absolutely vouch for progress in this area already as compared to the Veda I knew in high school. She is much more outgoing than she used to be, but still maintains a level of shyness that is appropriate but a potential area of development if she were to become a PL or RA. ","Veda would be most successful with first-years, ideally as a PL. The first year at college consists of so many things thrown at you at once, and I know personally that Veda juggled a lot of different things. She almost didn't apply for FAB, she switched her major, and chemistry didn't treat her too well (does it treat anyone well?). These are the sorts of experiences that make a great PL and she is an ideal fit for representing those experiences.  As for the types of personalities that best match her, I would say she would fit better with students who would rather be approached than approach others, i.e. those more on the shy side. I believe Veda has some shyness in her, but has adjusted to this during her final year in high school and first semester at Georgia Tech and therefore has an understanding of others that are shy. This is not to say that she wouldn't mesh well with those that are hyper and socially active all the time, just that she would connect more closely with those that are more shy.   I don't think there is any personality type that clashes with Veda at all. Instead, she would likely connect best with those that are more shy, as I mentioned, and simply connect normally with others. The shyness factor is not a hard and fast rule, just an approximation. Her two best friends in high school were not shy at all, for instance, but she connected very closely to the flutes that were shy whereas other section leaders did not.","Without a doubt, Veda would make a great SSM. In my mind, she is the perfect mix of traits that make up a great PL. She would be willing and able to organize events, approach others, be approachable, mediate conflicts, and recommend resources (or at least defer to those better informed if she was not very well acquainted with a certain major or something) to students in need. She personally used many of these resources her first semester and therefore would be able to easily recommend these to other students. She is outgoing but not so much that she is off-putting to those with a shy disposition; instead, she attracts those that are shy due to her gentle nature. Veda is one of the most open-minded people I know, and therefore would not be an issue when it comes to issues such as racial or sexual offensiveness. She is well-mannered and would never dare say anything to offend any group of people, and this is an especially important trait of someone with responsibilities such as a PL. Overall, Veda gets my seal of approval very easily and I hope that she gets yours too!","Veda has been a great member of Freshman Activities Board, which involves responsibilities that include community outreach and holding events. There is a lot of crossover between Freshman Activities Board and PL RA positions in terms of the qualities that make a good one, and Veda is certainly a great member of FAB.

Her strengths are that she would set a good example of time management, and that she is always friendly and light hearted on the floor.

I believe that she would grow as a person with more leadership responsibility and that it would strengthen her values and commitments to GT.,I believe that Veda would be successful with either first-years or upperclassmen. She is a very relatable person and has a personality that puts you at ease. She works most well with those who are light hearted and have a sense of humor. I believe she would work the least well of those who do not want to participate. ,"Yes, I believe that Veda would make an excellent SSM. I believe that she fully understands what the role entails and how to balance being a student and a SSM. She has a wide variety of friends and know how to interact with different personalities.

For one, he has a very charismatic personality that can instantly connect with anyone. From the moment I met Will he was full of smiles and cheer, and his enthusiasm made him a natural leader on the floor from the start. Will also has an instinctual knack for leadership. He is driven by serving others, and is very cooperative with his team. He especially demonstrated this during his time as Hall Council president. He always made sure that everybody was heard, but also was able to effectively run meetings and make decisions without delay. ",One area that Will could develop his knowledge in as a potential SSM is understanding the different resources on campus that are available for students. I taught Will a lot about the different resources (both academic and extra-curricular) that students have at their fingertips but there are still so many I didn't expose him to. I believe that SSM training does an excellent job in teaching PLs and RAs about these resources and so he will develop his knowledge through these training sessions. ,"I believe Will would do best with first-year residents. He is very comfortable with first interactions and getting people to step outside their comfort zone. On the floor, Will was always leading events to get the floor together and to bond with each other. Whether it is organizing movie nights or jamming out with instruments outside, Will finds way to include everyone. I know these qualities are essential to be an effective Peer Leader, and Will would do an excellent job in helping first years thrive at Georgia Tech. ","Yes! Will would be a great SSM because he is engaging, a people-person, creative, and motivated. I know that he will be able to balance the work-load that comes along with the SSM position and his residents will look up to him as a role model. ","Will has been enthusiastic about being an SSM since his first semester at Georgia Tech. Unfortunately he wasn't able to apply last year due to a conflict, but this year he is very excited about the process and I wholeheartedly believe that he is an ideal candidate for a Student Staff Member position.

Firstly, he is a strong student with a good work ethic. He is both socially diverse and socially adaptable. He is a prominent follower of open door policy and often has others visit, but he also makes sure to visit people both through the hall and in other dorms. He is friendly and capable of discussing sensitive topics. I have never known him not to be welcoming and takes part in hall area wide events. For a short list: Friendly, inviting, socially experienced, very professional, respecting, caring, capable of problem solving, and fun.","I have not seen much of his leadership skills, so it's possible that they are lacking. However, he has not been in many instances where he had to use them yet as a freshman, so I think if he was placed in a leadership position he would easily be able to perform.","Both first years and upperclassmen would work. He is capable of connecting with all types of personalities, but he is slightly introverted, so unless he really tried to connect with someone else who was introverted it is possible that he may not get to know them that well even if they are compatible. He may not work well with people that have respect issues though, because he is not very firm, but it is difficult not to respect how kind, polite, and fun he is.",Absolutely. I think any staff would be lucky to have him. He both very reliable and very enjoyable. I can see him being very successful on any hall.,N A.,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Yes,N A.

I think that the SSM position would help her learn how to set priorities and manage her time so that she can balance the RA PL duties along with her academic coursework.,"This candidate would be most successful interacting with first-year students because she can lead and mentor them as they struggle through their first year at Tech as well as befriend them and encourage them to be involved in the community. Amanda works well with all types of people and personalities the best being open, easy-going personalities and the worst being rude arrogant high-strung personalities.",I think Amanda would be a great SSM because she really cares about people and is willing to invest time and effort into developing relationships. This kind of dedication and a heart for serving would make her stand out as an SSM who actually  gets to know her residents and cater to their needs through her events and interactions with them.,Amanda has worked with a crisis text hotline so she is capable of handling other people's personal issues and diffusing critical situations.,Good,Good,Good,Good,Excellent,Excellent,Excellent,Good,Excellent,Good,Yes,"Amanda tends to take on a lot of responsibilities, which sometimes interferes with her academics.

I am her overseeing president.,I have known Amanda since high school since we both attended Northview. I have known her for about 2-3 years now but only this past year have I had the chance of overseeing her when she served as the advocacy coordinator for AMSA. ,Amanda would make a good addition because she makes people comfortable when talking to him. She also makes an effort to get to know others. She has the ability to manage as a leader and delegate efficiently as I have seen her do in the past. All these qualities allow her to build a successful community and I think that is her biggest asset as an SSM. ,Amanda at times can be a little 'too fun' but that would something that makes her an even better SSM. She sometimes lacks focus in things and does things she enjoys a little more. But her love and passion to do what is fun allows her to truly enjoy them. She really values this SSM role so I am sure she will find a way to mix both and really to a fantastic job handling her residents and developing an nurtured community. ,"Amanda would be a great PL who works with first-years. She already has so much knowledge of how to help underclassmen, especially through AMSA where she serves as a mentor. But she also has a lot of freshmen in her advocacy sector of AMSA which she really takes in and guides to make sure they have all that they need. For these reasons, I think Amanda would make for a terrific PL. ","Yes, having known Amanda for so long, I truly believe that she can be a good SSM.

More so, she is always so eager to be involved with community events and give back just like an SSM should be.

Ability to work with people from across cultures.","Not sure exactly what area you are referring, but I would say knowledge of Georgia Tech's policies and procedures and depending on his placement working with graduate or older students vs first-years.  If you are asking about his potential, I believe he demonstrates great potential as an SSM as he cares for others and wants to help.","Again, the position he held was mostly working with first-years, but he also had to work with his peers so I believe he could work with upperclass students. The students he worked with were both introverts and extroverts and for the most part new to the U.S. culture and academic expectations; however he also worked with U.S. domestic students to help bridge cross-cultural understanding.","Reason mentioned above - calm, capable person who works with students from variety of cultures, domestic and international, ability to work with peers and professional staff.",Wholeheartedly recommend Yuanbo (Cody) Wang for this opportunity.

Eric is a very friendly and amiable individual, and is great at making others comfortable with him and is a clear communicator, helping him connect with residents and serving as a source of support for his residents and fellow staff members. I've also worked with him in planning social events for different sized groups, and he has the organizational skills necessary to plan and execute hall events and building wide events along with other staff. Eric also has an inspiring work ethic, willing to knock out any tasks put in front of him, and consistently meeting the deadlines and requirements set.

He articulates a lot more than people his age and definitely brings maturity into any position he is in. ",He can be quiet sometimes and takes some time to open up to people. I think that you need all types of SSMs and this quality is sometimes needed as well when it comes to a dynamic group. He can definitely work on his shyness if given the chance. ,I personally think he would work great with freshman. He definitely has the potential to work with upper-class men but at this stage he would work a lot better with freshman residents. He has a pretty calm personality and I think that is where he is most comfortable as well. I personally do not think he has had too much conflict resolution training and or experience so that is an area he may not work well with in the beginning until he gets some training. ,"Definitely, although every candidate has potential to grow, Eric has already shown great depth and growth since last year even from me being his PL to now being on SAA leadership with him. If that much can change in one year, I think he would be able to grow exponentially through being a SSM.
