In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Ananth for  two years as he has been on A-Town Showdown Executive board with me. Last year, we both were on different committees. This year, I am director and I have direct involvement with him and his actions and impacts on our organization. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ananth is the most social person I have ever met. He is extremely friendly and outgoing and isn't afraid to go out of his comfort zone to meet new friends and make them feel welcome. His position on A-Town Showdown board is Head Liaison. A-town showdown is a intercollegiate dance competition hosted at Georgia Tech! His task is to recruit 36 liaisons to help take care of 350+ dancers who come to Atlanta for 3 days. Once he interviews over 60 candidates and recruits 36 of them, it is his job for 5 months to make sure they are prepared and educated on all the logistics of show weekend ensuring that everyone stays on task and on time as well as ensuring all 36 liaisons feel comfortable. He is extremely friendly and approachable whenever these liaisons have monetary issues, or have disputes with other liaisons. He is also responsible for coordinating social events to make sure all the liaisons are engaged and are having fun throughout the five months they are with us. He leads three meetings which last 4-5 hours each in which he goes over crucial information pertaining to our dance competition and is one of our strongest leaders. He isn't afraid to speak up and give his opinions when we are having group discussions and he is always respectful with other people's opinions. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Ananth always creates detailed schedules and sticks to his logistical schedules ensuring he always completes all of his goals on time. I would say his areas of development would be to make sure he can fit all requirements onto his schedule. I'm not sure what his extra curriculars are like for next year. Making sure his workload is appropriate to make time for residents. In his first year of being head liaison, he had a heavy school workload and thus was a little less prepared to interview liaisons. But the following year, he caught his mistake and planned ahead for his schedule to have time for interview preparations. He constantly is growing and learning and has matured to learn how to manage his schedule better. I would definitely ask him of his extra curriculars for the following year! 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Ananth would work well with all types of residents. Ananth's liaisons are an amalgam of freshman, sophomore, juniors and seniors and he is able to lead them to success in our organization. I have no doubt in my mind that he can relate to any crowd he is placed in and he is a very strong candidate for your position. He relates well to all crowds. I believe that he specifically enjoys the upperclass students crowd more as he is able to relate more closely with them. He works well with mature, strong personalities. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Ananth would make an excellent SSM. He fits all of your requirements as he is extremely friendly and approachable, he knows how to organize formal and informal events, he definitely knows how to mediate interpersonal conflicts (monetary conflicts between liaisons), and knows how to bring a smile to everyones faces with his contagious personality. He is very liked by all of his liaisons as well as his fellow exec board members! 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Ananth is responsible, kind, caring, genuine, smart, funny, outgoing, and creative. He puts his heart into everything he commits to and is extremely passionate in everything he does. He does not give up when things get tough and he tries to come up with solutions.
