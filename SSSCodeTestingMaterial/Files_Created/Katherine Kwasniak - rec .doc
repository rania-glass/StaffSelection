In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Kasia is my resident this year and I've gotten to know her through midweek munchies and through the community development programs I have organized for the hall. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Kasia has the ability to learn very quickly and I think she has the level of calm to approach a problem with poise. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
