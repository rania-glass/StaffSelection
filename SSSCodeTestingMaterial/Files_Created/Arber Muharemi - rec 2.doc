In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have lived on the same floor as Arber and interacted with him on a frequent basis for the last 5 months since he arrived at Georgia Tech as a Freshman.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I would describe Arber's strengths very well rounded as his personality and way of life are in tune with what one looks for in a leader. He has shown great incentive to bring happiness to many people in our hall, earning himself a lot of respect from his peers. He is very inclusive when it comes to making friends and I have noticed how Arber has genuinely brought together people who were shy in the beginning. In my frequent personal interactions with him, I have picked up on how seriously he takes his academics and the strategies he uses to manage his time. No matter what the situation, to this date I have not noticed Arber get flustered at himself or anyone else. He handles situations with a sense of ease and calmness that is rare to find in today's day. He displays a confidence when interacting with everyone and is very well aware of people's sensitivities. With all this, he also has a lot of fun with people, is very witty and makes a lot of good puns that would keep staff and residents laughing!

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
The only potential areas of development I see for Arber would be learning specific ways of dealing with situations which would be covered during training and BCD's.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe this candidate would be great for all types of people, but I would recommend him to work with First-years. I feel that first-years would learn a lot from him since his interpersonal skills would be of great value to first-years who are seeking to get connected to the community.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I absolutely feel Arber would make a great SSM. A lot of my reasoning is based on the positivity he has brought to our floor and our community in Smith. He has a great sense of how to create an appropriate balance between work and play, that would make him excel at this job.
