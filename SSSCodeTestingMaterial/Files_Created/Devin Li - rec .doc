In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
1 year; Devin was in my 8-member BME team for BMED1300 (now 2250).

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Devin is a good listener and observer.  In his team, he had a reputation for thought-full engagement, that is, thinking first before blurting.  He's smart, he connects the dots, he's calm, and he's organized. I think he will be responsive to the needs of his residents and a positive role model.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I'm not sure to what this question refers.  In terms of his personal development, I the being an SSM will help him open up.

Devin's 1300 team was a mixed bag of personalities and abilities-- he was effective and respected by all.  So I'm not sure he has a 'type'.

Yes.  I believe he would be a good SSM for the above-stated reasons-- he is an excellent listener and a positive role model.
