In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known this applicant since the beginning of Fall 2015 through various group activities in Alpha Kappa Psi. While working together extensively, in classes and in the organization, we formed a good bond.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
The applicant is a very genuine, down to earth person who is always smiling and spreading energy. She is very creative in her thoughts and always works to keep everyone on the same page. She usually forms the basis of a pyramid in a team thus being highly reliable. These strengths will make her stand out as an SSM who is able to create a happy diverse community on her floor making sure not to leave anyone behind and transferring these skills while working with the staff team as well.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
The applicant will develop most in her adapting herself and her ideas to suit the needs of her residents. She might start off with a set idea, but I believe with time she will recognize how to best recognize the needs of her residents and use that to her advantage.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
She will be most successful with first year residents. She works most well with people who are self-motivated, creative and enthusiastic. She works least well with people who she can't relate to for example are overly competitive or power hungry.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe the candidate will make a great SSM because of her extrovert personality type that is always open to exploring new ideas. She also always desires to give back to the GT community from all that she has learned - a very good example of this is her dedication to the TEDx organization where in she motivate young student leaders to share their experiences. I believe this nature of her's of going that extra mile to make a difference in someone's life is what sets her apart. Another characteristic of her is that she is a very unbiased person always maintaining her discipline.
