Summer Honors

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Sally won the Most Outstanding Student award and the Character Award at Summer Honors 2014. Summer Honors is a two-week residential academics and leadership program for talented teens in the southeast. Sally is charming, kind, graceful, athletic. She’s energetic. Underneath a calm and confident exterior is a motivated and driven competitor. Early on during our two weeks of camp we could see Sally emerging as one of our most influential campers. Others gravitate to her. In a crowd, she’s not the obvious center of attention. She quietly influences others by developing relationships. People are drawn to her – they watch her and want to be like her. She welcomes everyone into her network offering kind words, funny quips and friendly advice. She leads by example, giving her all for the event and her team, and she leads by serving others with encouraging words, assistance and strong effort.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I will offer some evaluations that we made regarding Sally during Summer Honors: Displayed a great attitude throughout the entire camp. She showed that she was very adaptable, I never saw her with the same person or group of people during the day.  She was always with somebody different and having a great time with them. Sally definitely has potential [for] leadership. Her team naturally looks to her for guidance. In one activity that she was not able to participate in, she continued to cheer her team on from the sidelines. Sally is a leader. She is really strong in her faith, and is helping lead the girls in a bible study with Allyssa.  She is a social butterfly! I love how she is always hanging out with a different group.		 Sally had a really upbeat attitude every time I was around her.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Sally, at age 17 when she attended Summer Honors, was already far more mature and capable than all but the very top students we've had at Summer Honors during that last 10 years (over 400 students). I believe she simply needs some experience as an SSM to become a very important part of the leadership team.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Sally, given her age, would probably best be placed with first-year. She is very adaptable and reaches out to everyone.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. I have worked with dozens of UNG RA's and campus leaders during my 10 years as director of Summer Honors. I believe Sally has the character required. She's personable, able to connect with almost any personality and type of person.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I wish Sally had matriculated at UNG. However, I wish her all the best. Sally impressed me. She is one of the finest students we have had attend Summer Honors since 2005 when I became director. I recommend her wholeheartedly.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Sally is unique in the history of Summer Honors. She won both our 2014 Leadership Award and our 2014 Most Outstanding Student Award. (I made a mistake earlier and said she won the Character Award. She would have if she hadn't won so many of our top awards already.)
