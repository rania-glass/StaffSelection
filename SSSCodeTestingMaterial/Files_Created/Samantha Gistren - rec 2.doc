In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Samantha since August of 2015.  She is my resident.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Sammi is the type of person that really wants to make a difference.  She is a natural leader and role model among her peers.  She is kind, has a great sense of humor, and is friends with almost everyone in the building.  Her passion, wit, and strong values will take her far in this position.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
This is a really difficult question to answer.  One area of development may be the program planning.  I think Samantha will do a great job at this based on her character traits, but, to my knowledge, she hasn't had the opportunity to do this yet.  I think planning programs for your first time is inevitably a learning experience, so this would be an area of development for her.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Sammi would be most successful working with first year students.  I could see her in an environment where she is able to serve as a mentor to younger students.  I think she would do great with upperclassmen as well, but I think she would be more happy and more passionate about her job if she was a PL.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Samantha would be a great SSM.  She is one of the most responsible and mature girls on my floor.  Her peers look up to her as a friend and mentor.  She is known for her kindness, love of people, and strong work ethic,  

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I think Sammi would be a great asset to any staff.  She would fit in great with any staff and would get along great with fellow SSMs.  I also see her being an SSM that loves her job and goes above the call of duty to make sure her residents are happy and doing the right thing.
