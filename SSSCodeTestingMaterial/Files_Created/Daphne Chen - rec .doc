N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been her Peer Leader for a little over a semester now and we interact at least every other week

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Daphne is a very friendly individual with anyone that approaches her. She is not overbearing and at she is not always at every single event gathering, but she is always friendly and welcoming to everyone around her. She also has been able to get involved outside of the hall and has proven that she is willing and happy to accept challenges and she continuously pushes herself to achieve more. One example is that she is very active in Hack-GT and in her business fraternity. This determination for bettering herself gives me confidence that as a PL, she will strive to do the best she can. The welcoming attitude just comes naturally to her, so I know this will help her greatly in the PL RA position as well.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
She seems to lean towards introversion, which is certainly not a bad thing but it can potentially make it more difficult for her to comfortably plan events with residents. However, I have noticed that she is always doing fun events (hiking in the smokey mountains, having movie nights, ping pong tournaments, etc) with her friends in the other halls so she might be more extroverted than I have realized. I cannot think of any potential areas of development besides this one, and I honestly do not know for sure if this is even an area that she needs to develop. Her introversion makes her incredibly approachable and genuine in her interactions as well, so I have come to really appreciate it. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe Daphne has the capability to work with either first-years or upperclassman, however due to her young age, I believe she would be more compatible comfortable with first-years. She also spoke a lot about believing that freshman year is the most important year in your college career and she would love to guide the first-years in this journey and give them advice that helped her succeed as well. Daphne seems to work very well with the quieter first –years, which tend to be the ones that need the most assistance from their Peer Leaders. However, whenever she ends up in conversation with more extroverted, loud people, she seems to keep up with the conversation well and she always takes interest in what everyone has to say.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do believe Daphne would make a good PL or RA because of her kind-hearted nature, her dedication to her work, and her genuine reasons for applying. I unfortunately do not see her enough to know fully whether she would be the perfect PL or not, but she is definitely worth considering for the position. She certainly has a great work ethic and care for others. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
 I will do my best to get to know this resident better over the next few weeks, so please reach out to me with any more specific questions!

Would you hire this applicant?
Yes, but with reservations

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
I only say 'with reservations' because I don't know her well enough yet. But still, from what I can tell, I'm sure she would do a great job.
