Teacher  High School Advisor

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant since he was a 6th grader and taught him for four consecutive years. I remained as his advisor and worked with him with several clubs and throughout the program.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Everybody loves and respects this student.  They know that he will follow the rules, and respect his authority.  Authority can be given, but in this case others see Priyesh in a supervisory role because of their respect.  In addition, he has served as the leader of numerous clubs and organizations through out high school.  He would organize and was considered the heart of his class.  He is non-judgmental, caring, funny, and always has people's best interest at heart.  People always feel that he is approachable and remaining high school students are still seeking his advice.  He is seen as someone with no enemies and loved by all types of population.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
This really is a natural fit for this individual's talents.  Leadership must always be developed and I am sure he will grow, especially in finding resources and making sure to connect student body with administration.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This student will work well with all personalities.  From the highly energetic to the academically struggling.  I think he will especially be able to identify students who may not be adjusting well and approach them in a non-threatening way and suggest resources.  I have not seen him have a conflict with another student these past four years of high school as he truly is generally accepting.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
It has been decades, but I served as an RA in my college and I did not possess half the skills or abilities this student has.  He will be one of your more likable RA's, approachable, energetic and genuinely positive and enthusiastic.  He will faithfully execute all duties asked of him, and he will want to make a difference in the lives of those around him.  

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I will gladly speak further and expand on all of the social functions and related activities this student did while he was in high school.  I have the pleasure of teaching some of the brightest students in Georgia for over 12 years.  In my entire career this is one of the most amazing students I have ever taught.  He is brilliant and not socially awkward, but instead a person who loves and can bring together all types of people.
