In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been the RA in Kavya's building for 1 semester 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Clearly communicates with others Interested in interacting with the community and everyone in it Has identified things that can be improved in our housing area and wants to work with current staff to make the community stronger Good understanding of the needs of the graduate student community

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Working for housing will help Kavya expand her network and incorporate more personal interactions into her routine to make sure she stays balanced during grad school.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Best case, this applicant would be placed in an area with mostly graduate students, but upper class undergraduates would be ok too.  As a young phd student she would be best able to relate and support other graduate students, but is not too far out from her undergrad to be disconnected from undergraduate residents.

I think that Kavya would be a good SSM because she really cares about planning programs that will make our community a good home for graduate students.
