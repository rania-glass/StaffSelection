In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Aman has been my resident since the beginning of Fall 2015. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Aman is an extremely strong team player and is always willing to lend a helping hand. Aman treats everyone as a friend but still realizes the difference between having fun and getting things done.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
He always likes to be active and be doing things at all times. He can definitely improve on this habit since sometimes you need to calm down, have a more focused approach but he has definitely calmed down since coming to Tech. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
First-years would be my opinion. Aman has a lot of energy and is always willing to accommodate new people in activities. As a student who is out of state, he reinvented himself this past semester (according to him) and I know he could help others in that regard since he has an optimistic outlook on things. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, Aman would make a great SSM because he understands a lot about working with staff members and first year students. Along with that, he understands the administrative sides as well the importance of the position. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
None that I can think of as of now.
