What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Maybe focusing his time and considerably energy. He does a lot well!

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Shane is open to and comfortable with all kinds of difference - race and ethnicity, socio-economic, physical, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity, and faith traditions. He's not dogmatic or judgmental, and I think most kids would take to him quickly.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I have known Shane for 5 years, and worked closely with him for 4 of  those 5. It has been a great joy to watch him grow into himself in an intensely rigorous boarding school community. He was a pied-piper for students in Rwanda. One boy, Ben, described Shane as his third father -- after God and his biological father! This is emblematic of friendships he formed with lots of students he countered there.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Shane and two friends had a brush with our disciplinary system during spring of his senior year. Rather than become bitter or disenfranchised, Shane learned and grew from his indiscretion.
