In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Prachi was one of me residents last year when she was a freshman.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Prachi is very hard working, organized,  and kind. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Prachi had a tendency to stay in her room and did not go out of her way to meet her hall mates, which I believe are important as a SSM.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Prachi would be better with upper class students. She is very organized and I think would but on great programs but would be better with residents that don't need constant support, like freshman. I believe Prachi works well with outgoing personalities that are similar to her own. She seemed to get along most with the girls on the hall that were more present extroverted. I think she would have a harder time with residents who are more introverted that take time to develop relationships with.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Prachi has the essential qualities to be an SSM, but I think she would excel as a RA for upperclass man more so than a PL.
