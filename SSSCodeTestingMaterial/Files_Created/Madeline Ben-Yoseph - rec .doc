I taught Maddy for two years in high school

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Maddy was my physics student her junior year. Her senior year she came to me for help with AP Physics as well as assisted me weekly with some of my teaching responsibilities  such as grading and lab setup.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Maddy is easily one of the most socially adept students I have had in my decade of teaching experience. She has wonderful interpersonal skills and was well respected and liked by her peers and the faculty. She is easy to talk to, is good at managing groups of students, and has a wonderful work life balance for someone her age. She also is dedicated and hardworking to whatever she puts her mind to. Having never played competitively before, she started and built up a Chicago City Championship Lacrosse program at our school. As someone who runs many clubs and activities, I know the skills involved with managing schedules, maintaining interest and discipline, and relating to students on a professional but still personal level are integral to an RA position and skills Maddy not only has but has refined over the years. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Maddy is kind and holds herself to a very high standard. Additionally, the high school she attended and where I know her from is one of the top rated public schools in the state and draws the best students from all over Chicago. All of my interactions with Maddy took place in this environment, so I do not know how she would relate to students who are not as driven or focused as she. That said, our school is the most diverse school in the state. I would not be concerned with her interaction with any particular group of students as she is from as diverse and rich area socio-economically, ethnically, and racially area as is possible to have. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
My guess is first or second year students, although I have no doubt she would be excellent working with anyone. I have never seen her have a negative interaction with another person. I know she is able to work with all kinds of personalities. Maddy is someone who excelled in my physics class working with some of the best students in Chicago and who started our school's womens lacrosse team and then built it up to a city championship program by her senior year, so she works well with many different types in many different environments.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. As someone who was an RA for two years in college, I recognize many of the skills that were looked for by our staff in potential SSMs. Again, she is hard-w0rking, reliable, polite, fun, and likeable. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
During Maddy's senior year she was in a class with one of my colleagues who is notoriously difficult to deal with amongst both students and faculty. She handled the year with no complaining and a wonderful level of grace. My coworker had nothing but nice things to say about Maddy, and she made the best of a rough situation. I would expect her to handle difficult moments or even long term situations  in the same manner.
