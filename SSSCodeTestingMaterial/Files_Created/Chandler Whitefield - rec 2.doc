In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Chandler and I lived on the same hall freshman year. She was also my roommate during the summer when we took classes. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
She is very friendly and easy to talk to. She makes conversation flow and doesn't let others to feel left out. She is very organized and dedicated to her school work and extra curricular activities. She works very well in teams, but she can also be a leader when it is required. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think she could be introduced to a little more diversity to make her more aware. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think she would work well with mostly upperclassmen because she wants to have a more laid back approach to leading. While she can definitely become personal with others, she works well with others when they are on top of their stuff. She works well with people that have similar passions as her and doesn't work well with people that have no dedication. Because she is heavily involved in her school work and research, she might not be as available to freshmen as needed, but in terms of being an RA, I think she would be great because she can relate to others very well. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I think she would be a good SSM. She works well in teams, but she can also be that leader. She is on top of her work. She also is a genuinely friendly person.
