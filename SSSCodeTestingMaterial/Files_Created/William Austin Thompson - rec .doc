Former Hallmate (Towers), Fraternity Brother

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've known Austin since I moved into Towers Freshman dorm. Because we are in the same fraternity I've continued to stay in contact with him.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Austin's involvement on campus have put him in an excellent position to be an SSM. His work with FAB, in addition to the work he puts into event organization in our Fraternity mean that he has the experience and know how to get residents involved, excited, and having a good time. His knowledge of campus, work on the student government Diversity committee, and work in general on campus have make him well rounded and able to deal with many of the more difficult problems a PL may face. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Once Austin has picked a path he tends to stick to it. While determination is a great trait in most cases, I feel that if Austin's community development did not work out initially, it would take time for him to change his methods.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Austin I think would click well with new students, as well as returning second and third years, owing to his forward personality and peculiar humor. Austin will work will with nearly every resident, the only major  issues I see would be with residents not at all interested in any development (career or community) since Austin tends to be goal oriented.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Austin has the makings of the one SSM who plans events, all the residents know, and joke with. He's got a personality that will work well and the skills and experience to make residence life fun. I absolutely think he'd be a great fit.

Austin is, in casual settings, very sarcastic, and can keep a straight face through most jokes. This could cause residents to be unsure of if he is being serious or not at times.
