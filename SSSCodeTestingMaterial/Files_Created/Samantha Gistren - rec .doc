In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Samantha for one semester. I have interacted with her in the Grand Challenges class, and also helped to advise her in a project she is working on with Engineers for a Sustainable World. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Samantha is a very sincere person.  She is easy to talk to and takes the time to invest in people.  She is also a very motivated person who will go the extra mile for something is passionate about. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Samantha perhaps needs to project a little more in talking to larger groups.  I feel like her experience as a PL would help her develop this leadership trait. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think that at this point she would work the best with Grand Challenges Freshman.  She would be a sophomore during this time, and she would have the shared experience of being a Grand Challenges student herself.  I think that she can work with with both introverts and extroverts.  She might not work quite as well with aggressive personalities that are overly confrontational.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think that she would be a GREAT Peer Leader for the Grand Challenges students.   She is a natural leader and a great role model for the students. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Samantha speaks several languages and has relatives in the US and in Sweden.  She has also lived in Brazil. This international experience gives her a maturity that helps her deal with many different types of people, and I think she would be an asset to your program.
