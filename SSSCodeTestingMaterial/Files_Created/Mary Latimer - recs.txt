In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Mary since our freshman year. We have had classes together and have worked together on projects and other efforts at CCF.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Mary is friendly and approachable and always ready to listen. She goes out of her way constantly to make sure people are taken care of. People matter to Mary. She can remain calm and think clearly in stressful situations. Mary will do what's right no matter what the crowd is doing she has a strong moral compass and respects the rules for what they are.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Mary has a great potential for growth in reaching out to less active residents. It is easy for many SSMs to put residents they don't see very much out of their minds. I believe Mary would accept the challenge and try to connect and create a substantial relationship with each resident. She would learn how to create a place for every resident in the community.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe Mary would work best with upperclassmen students. She  is compassionate and encouraging but not overly enthusiastic or energetic as many first-years need. Mary works well with both laid-back and high-strung individuals. I believe she works least well with individuals who are unable to compromise or understand reason. Mary works best with people who can express there thought and feelings. She likes to find connections with others and support them.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Mary would make a great SSM. She handles all situations calmly and efficiently. She cares about those around her and is always ready to hear about their day. She has a passion for doing special things to let people know how special and important they are. I believe she would do this and more for her residents.
