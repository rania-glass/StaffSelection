Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
She is a member of Freshman Activities Board, of which I am an advisor.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant since my sophomore year of high school in 2011. She is a year below me and we have been good friends since then. We met in our concert band class and have remained friends since then.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Friendly and approachable' is certainly a quality that Veda exhibits and would absolutely be one of her strengths as a SSM. Since I've known Veda, she has always been a gentle and kind person who is easy to talk to and have a conversation with, even if you do not know her very well. I believe this quality would help her connect to residents that are more shy than others, which is an important role of the job. Friendships that Veda builds are always long-lasting and meaningful, with a lot of depth. This is a strength as well, as she would be willing and able to construct lasting relationships with her residents without leaving anyone out. It is worth noting that Veda acted as Section Leader for flutes in Marching Band, and thus has experience taking care of a group of people and being responsible for others. Her responsibilities included being kind and approachable as well as being firm enough to teach the band members to march properly and not 'goof' around too much, so to speak. She also planned and held get-togethers for the flutes, similar the informal social events mentioned as a responsibility of a SSM. I can vouch for Veda being very effective at this job, as I was the Drum Major of the Marching Band and my job was to preside over her (and all the sections) and make sure she was doing a good job. I never had any qualms with the way she did things, and the flutes were always the most uniform section of the band.  Additionally, Veda is excellent at conflict resolution. This was something that came up quite often in marching band, and Veda always took a mild but firm approach to solving this issue. She held enough authority that the band members new when Veda was being serious and wanted them to quit messing around, but was not so strong-handed as to give the band members a reason to dislike her. This is a hard to find quality and Veda certainly has it.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
While Veda is definitely friendly and approachable, Veda can be shy at times. While I believe this will appeal to some residents who are also shy and may be able to confide in that quality, I do believe that it is an area in which Veda can improve. With her being a member of FAB, I can absolutely vouch for progress in this area already as compared to the Veda I knew in high school. She is much more outgoing than she used to be, but still maintains a level of shyness that is appropriate but a potential area of development if she were to become a PL or RA. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Veda would be most successful with first-years, ideally as a PL. The first year at college consists of so many things thrown at you at once, and I know personally that Veda juggled a lot of different things. She almost didn't apply for FAB, she switched her major, and chemistry didn't treat her too well (does it treat anyone well?). These are the sorts of experiences that make a great PL and she is an ideal fit for representing those experiences.  As for the types of personalities that best match her, I would say she would fit better with students who would rather be approached than approach others, i.e. those more on the shy side. I believe Veda has some shyness in her, but has adjusted to this during her final year in high school and first semester at Georgia Tech and therefore has an understanding of others that are shy. This is not to say that she wouldn't mesh well with those that are hyper and socially active all the time, just that she would connect more closely with those that are more shy.   I don't think there is any personality type that clashes with Veda at all. Instead, she would likely connect best with those that are more shy, as I mentioned, and simply connect normally with others. The shyness factor is not a hard and fast rule, just an approximation. Her two best friends in high school were not shy at all, for instance, but she connected very closely to the flutes that were shy whereas other section leaders did not.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Without a doubt, Veda would make a great SSM. In my mind, she is the perfect mix of traits that make up a great PL. She would be willing and able to organize events, approach others, be approachable, mediate conflicts, and recommend resources (or at least defer to those better informed if she was not very well acquainted with a certain major or something) to students in need. She personally used many of these resources her first semester and therefore would be able to easily recommend these to other students. She is outgoing but not so much that she is off-putting to those with a shy disposition; instead, she attracts those that are shy due to her gentle nature. Veda is one of the most open-minded people I know, and therefore would not be an issue when it comes to issues such as racial or sexual offensiveness. She is well-mannered and would never dare say anything to offend any group of people, and this is an especially important trait of someone with responsibilities such as a PL. Overall, Veda gets my seal of approval very easily and I hope that she gets yours too!

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Veda has been a great member of Freshman Activities Board, which involves responsibilities that include community outreach and holding events. There is a lot of crossover between Freshman Activities Board and PL RA positions in terms of the qualities that make a good one, and Veda is certainly a great member of FAB.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
If you are curious, it is pronounced VEE-DUH, not VAY-DUH. Although, it is fun to call her Darth Veda.
