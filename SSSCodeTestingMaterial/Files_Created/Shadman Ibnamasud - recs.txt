In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Shadman is one of my best chemistry students in my 1211K lab.  I've known him for a semester (4 months)

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Shadman is very organized and meticulous.  He is on top of every task and always performs each, no matter how trivial, to the best of his abilities.  Also, he is very personable and friendly and gets along well with everyone.  He often works in between groups helping others even at the expense of his own progress.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Shadman has a good foundation to be an excellent adviser or even a teacher.  I think that the experience as a potential SSM will only develop these strengths even more through event planning, advising, encouraging, and leading other students.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I expect that Shadman can relate easily with mostly first-years due to their ages being mostly similar but I don't see any complications between him and upperclass students.  I believe this because he seems much more mature than most first-years that I've known.  Shadman has a good blend of a serious down-to-business attitude and a easy-going humor.  I believe that he has the ability to work well with nearly any personalty type due to this adaptability.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, Shadman exerts all of the basic characteristics that I would expect from a good SSM.  He is always very helpful and can speak to anyone on their level of understanding which I believe is an invaluable ability to have.  Additionally, his demeanor and personality makes him very approachable.  His organization level makes him perfect for organizing events and functions for constituents.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Shadman is one of my best students.  He is very intelligent and works very hard. He would make an excellent SSM.
