In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Katherine Markowski is one of my residents this year in Hopkins.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Katherine is highly active on our hall and is very personable. She comes out to all of our events and is even organizing one of her own this semester, as well as a few next semester. She is well liked by all of our residents. Even with her own roommate conflict, she settled it quickly and her roommate still enjoys her company. She is a 'people-person' and is very good at relating to all types of people on our hall.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Katherine is very focused on school, and I have seen her go through the tough adjustment from high school to college work load. I think time management will be something that will need to be developed more when she moves into being an SSM. However, she balances her classwork and social life well now, so I know she will be able to make the transition all SSMs have to make when starting the job.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Katherine would work well with freshmen women or undergraduates. I think she would have a hard time in an area like GLC or 10th and home due to her lack of life experience. Katherine works well with everyone, but I think she would do well with laid back personalities who want to be active on the hall, so West campus might suit her well.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Katherine would do very well in the position. She essentially shadows me now, so I think she already knows a lot about what it takes to be a good PL and is committed to getting the job done. Also, she seems genuinely interested in becoming influential in her community and helping students any way she can.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Although I think Katherine would be best in a very involved community, I think she could rise to the challenge of any PL or RA position. She relates to everyone she meets and builds relationships with them, and I think she could excel anywhere in housing.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
All areas that I marked as 'good' were just ones I haven't seen her use as often on our hall. I know she still possesses them, but I have seen her use the other qualities in very memorable situations.
