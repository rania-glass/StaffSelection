Friend

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been acquainted with Navya for a couple of years now, but in the last few months, she has become one of my closest friends.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Navya is perhaps one of the most understanding, supportive, and considerate people in my life. She is always willing to go above and beyond for those that she cares about, and is personally invested in the well-being of her friends (and her potential residents).

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I don't see any outstanding areas of development that warrant serious concern regarding Navya's position as an SSM. If I had to pick something, I think a potential area of development would be with the more casual interactions with residents.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Navya would be most successful with upperclass residents, due to her ability to effectively communicate with those of a higher level of maturity, especially about more serious topics. She may not be able to form bonds quite as close with those with naturally abrasive personalities, but I don't believe it would affect her abilities as an SSM.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I absolutely believe that Navya would make a good SSM, due to her innate sense of empathy and caring, her ability to comfort those in need, and her willingness to go above and beyond for anyone.
