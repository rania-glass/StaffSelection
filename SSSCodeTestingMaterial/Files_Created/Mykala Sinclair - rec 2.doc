In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
One semester. Mykala is a resident on my floor since August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Mykala is very personable, approachable, passionate, and enthusiastic. She has an infectious positive attitude and sense of humor. She isn't afraid to put herself into a position of leadership or attention and works hard to include others on the floor in group activities. She is full of energy, constantly dancing around the dorm, putting a smile on other's faces. She is knowledgeable and passionate in areas related to diversity and inclusion - and works to understand others different from herself. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I believe that she could develop more polished professional skills through this position. Additionally, I think she has some experience programming, but she would be able to polish these skills through this position. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
First year students.  She works really well with almost any personality, but best with individuals that are seeking interaction. She works less well with more shy individuals, but is not bad with them.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
YES! Mykala's positive attitude and energy has been infectious on the floor. She has supported her peers faithfully and constantly works towards strengthening the community on the floor (which she considers her home).  She is very creative and would learn to program very well - showcasing her personal interests and talent for art. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Mykala comes from a very unique and diverse background. I believe this has made her extremely approachable, and will help her succeed as a SSM.
