In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Micah is gifted with an enthusiastic energy and an honest concern for others. During my encounters with Micah, he showed a consistently positive attitude towards others and always seemed excited to welcome others into an activity. His peers enjoyed his presence because he would bring enthusiasm into the group. Micah also initiates conversations with others without timidity, showing an honest interest in how others are doing. He goes beyond a simple greeting and takes the time to listen, even if the individual was not expecting to exchange more than a simple greeting.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As a potential SSM, Micah can continue developing confidence and holding an objective stance when facing confrontation. At times, I observed Micah showing low self-esteem when he experienced academic and physical obstacles. Although he expressed his doubts about himself at times, he would soon return to his usual enthusiastic attitude. I have also observed Micah struggling to stay objective when his peers were in conflict. Through training, I believe Micah will learn how to navigate as a mediator during conflicts.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe Micah would be best suited to lead first-year students, although he would be a strong SSM for upper-classmen, also. Micah’s enthusiasm and initiative would greatly serve first-year students who seek positive-minded leaders. His thoughtful interest in others would also reach first-year students who may be timid or may face difficulties during their transitions. I have not seen Micah work poorly with any certain personality. However, I see that he works best with agreeable initiators, as he enjoys being an enthusiastic follower behind a cause. I predict that he may struggle working with very assertive or overbearing personalities, as he can be sensitive towards others’ strong attitudes or comments.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Micah exemplifies, through his past involvements and attitude, that he would be a great SSM. During his first year, he was very involved in the hall, often serving as an active presence during Hall Council meetings. Micah rarely spent time alone because he enjoyed studying in groups and spending time with others, always taking each opportunity to connect with others. Additionally, his passion for joining in on any activity—whether it may be helping a friend or attending a Georgia Tech event, helped his peers unify as a group. Although Micah was often seen with a group, Micah also exemplifies concern and care for individuals. Micah takes the time to ask others how they are doing and shows patient empathy when listening to others. Through his positive influence and genuineness, I believe Micah will succeed as an SSM.
