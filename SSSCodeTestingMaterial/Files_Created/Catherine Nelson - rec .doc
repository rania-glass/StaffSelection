In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I was Katie's AP Biology instructor during 2014-2015 school year.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I have witnessed Catherineâ€™s work ethic, personal commitment, dependability, and self-initiative. She distinguishes herself as being a remarkably honest, hard-working, and respectful student.  In addition, as an 'Army Brat,' Katie has attended multiple schools and moved constantly, exposing her to diverse cultures and ethnicities. This is evident in how she demonstrates tolerance and sensitivity to others' needs.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As Catherine (Katie) is a freshman and 18 years of age, her time at GA Tech will expand her knowledge and experience in working with others who have different perspectives and value systems.  

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
First-year students.  Katie can work with all age groups; however her compassion and patience lend her to work with students younger than she. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
ABSOLUTELY! Her maturity level is extremely high and demonstrated by the concerted effort she puts forth when completing tasks and working with other students. This is most amplified during AP Biology inquiry-based investigative labs when Catherine consistently led her group in designing, conducting, and presenting their results. Beyond her strong academic traits, Catherine has this infectious positive attitude and problem-solving nature, making her the ultimate student mentor.
