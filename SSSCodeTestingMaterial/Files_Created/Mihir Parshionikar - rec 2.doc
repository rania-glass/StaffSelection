N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Mihir has been my resident for a full semester so far, and I am looking forward to having him on my hall Spring semester. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I noticed that Mihir had excellent one-on-one soft skills the first day that I met him. He initiated conversations with other residents and they continue to spend time together on the hall. This is an important trait among Student Staff Members, and would make Mihir a valuable addition to any staff on campus. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I have enjoyed watching Mihir's leadership abilities improve over the past semester while spending time with large groups of residents, and I believe that his skills would continue to improve while on staff. He has devoted time and effort to growing more comfortable with large groups of residents while at dinner or studying in the lounge. This skill will undoubtedly continue to develop over time, possibly even more quickly while on staff. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Mihir has expressed interest in working with both freshman and upperclassmen, and I believe that both age groups would benefit from his presence on the hall. He is mature enough to handle situations involving older students, yet humble and patient enough to bond with a freshman who is new to Georgia Tech. I have noticed that he gets along with students that aren't typically social, which is not an easy feat. Mihir's calm demeanor allows him to work well with students that have strong, loud personalities, yet he is still working to improve these relationships. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I am convinced that Mihir would be an excellent addition to any current staff. He works well with others, manages his time effectively, and completes tasks without any procrastination. He is genuinely interested in his community and I believe that he would work hard to keep everyone on his hall satisfied with their experience at Georgia Tech. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
While deciding whether or not I would write a recommendation for Mihir I asked myself if I would appreciate having him as my PL freshman year. Without any hesitation I decided that I would have benefited from his friendship and guidance, and I hope students will have this opportunity in the future.
