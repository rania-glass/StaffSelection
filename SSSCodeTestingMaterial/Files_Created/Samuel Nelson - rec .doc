In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been Sam's Peer Leader since the beginning of the fall semester.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Sam is one of, if not the best community builders I have ever come across. Even as a first-year resident, he has become a leader on the floor, in terms of coming up with unique, engaging ways of bringing the floor together, as well as by consistently demonstrating a willingness to put in immense personal effort towards making these community builders a reality. Sam is also extremely well liked by his peers, and is trusted as a confidant and friend. Finally, as evidenced by the way he acted during a situation with his roommate, he is strong-willed enough to want to address a conflict, tactful enough to want to find the least destructive way to approach it, and mature enough to ask me for help. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I see Sam as the type of potential SSM who would excel in programming for residents, especially casual, floor-centric events. However, I feel as though he could further develop his skills with regards to encouraging residents to help him put on these events, rather than simply doing all the work himself.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Sam would be most successful with first-years. He has a very friendly, outgoing, and parental personality, and I feel as though he would be well suited to working with the generally energetic, guidance-seeking personalities of first-years rather than the typically more independent upperclassmen or grad family.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I would wholeheartedly recommend Sam to be an SSM. Oftentimes, I feel as though with the energy, positivity, and community that he brings to the floor, he is already an acting Peer Leader although he may not have been officially hired by the department. He provides that sort of presence to the floor already, and I would be excited to see the great things he does as an employed SSM.
