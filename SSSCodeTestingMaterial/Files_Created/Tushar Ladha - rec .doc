What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I actually can't think of any. But he will have to balance his college studies with outside activities.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Tushar would be excellent helping first year students since he is friendly and willing to help others. I have seen him grow and mature and I think he will continue to mature while in this role. I think Tushar works best with people that want to work in a team based approach. He is a social person and is best when in that setting.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Leading others comes naturally to Tushar. He takes responsibility for actions and or mistakes and learns from them to improve his performance. Tushar has served as a co-op ambassador for CF Industries and I am proud to have him represent CF. He also assists us with recruiting other co-op students. He has a spark and people naturally gravitate to him.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Tushar has been one of our top engineering co-op students and I would highly recommend him for this role.
