Sidney has been a resident of mine now for two semesters (Summer and Fall 2015). We are also on the Georgia Tech Cheerleading Team together.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
As an SSM, we must have the ability to cater to all types of people. Sidney has the ability not only to talk and be friendly with many different groups of people, but she tends to befriend them for long term relationships. I feel this is the most important aspect to being a PL.

I would suggest Sidney work with first year students. Being a Freshman now, this will allow her an easier environment to work in.

I do believe Sidney would make a good SSM. The personality of every SSM I know is matched by Sidney. She is involved in many things which will need some time management learning, but I am confident she can easily pick up on these skills.
