N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I was Mary's peer leader for her first year in college. After that we became close friends and colleagues. I have known Mary for about 3 years now.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Mary has many attributes that would contribute to her being a successful SSM. She deeply cares for each person she meets and is always willing to devote time to be an empathetic listener and innovative problem solver. Mary is a joy to work with in all projects and is a continuous fountain of creativity and enthusiasm. She strives for excellence and thrives to handle all situations with mature leadership and grace. I have no doubt that Mary would truly be an asset to any staff.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Mary is a perfectionist and will always try to devote the most time and effort to her residents and staff. Others around her would greatly benefit from her dedication and selfless giving, while she may have the opportunity to learn that striving for excellence and not perfection is often enough.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Mary has had a myriad of life experiences that would allow her to develop deep connections with any type of resident. Personally, I know that Mary would prefer to work with upperclass students, but she also enjoys working with freshmen in other on campus organizations. Through a desire to listen and learn from each person Mary meets, I believe any resident would be happy to have Mary as a SSM.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I full-heartedly believe that Mary would make an excellent SSM. Over the past 3 years, I have seen Mary learn and grow into a mature leader. She handles all situations with grace and thought and is one of the hardest working and caring people I know. She can work eloquently with those who are different than her and makes cultivating meaningful relationships a priority. Mary would add warmth, empathy, and creative intelligence to any staff.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Aside from Mary's many strong attributes, I believe that her passion and desire to be a SSM would also greatly fuel her ability to be a wonderful addition to the SSM community.
