Former Student

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I was a member of Micah's GT1000 group during the fall 2015 semester, and have known him since August 2015. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Micah fostered a sense of community within his GT1000 group, and was excellent at starting conversation with students who were reluctant to engage with others. He was approachable and charismatic which made it easy to come to him with issues, and he gave excellent advice about common freshman problems. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
He really valued having a positive relationship with his group members, and might have reservations about disciplining his future students if he thought they would be upset. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Micah worked well with the first-year students in his GT1000 group, and connected especially well with the motivated, outgoing members of the group who shared their experiences with him and asked for guidance. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Micah would make an excellent SSM, due to his passion and talent for mentoring younger students and the supportive environment he created in our GT1000 class.
