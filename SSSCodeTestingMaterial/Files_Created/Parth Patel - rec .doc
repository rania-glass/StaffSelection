Accelerated Pre-Calculus Teacher and SGA sponsor

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have had the pleasure of knowing Parth Patel for 3 years.  He was my SGA President and in my Accelerated Pre-Calculus class.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Parth is extremely organized, well-rounded, responsible and self-disciplined.  Parth is very approachable by all and prodigiously energetic.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I couldn't think of a better applicant to fulfill this position.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Parth can work with anyone.  He has never met an enemy!!!  I am certain that he will be an asset to your staff.  I think Parth would work well with incoming freshman the best because he knows the GT campus and the 'ins and outs' of campus life.  He would be fabulous to show the incoming students the 'ropes', the clubs on campus, and how to get involved in their education.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes I do!!! With Parths high standard for excellence and his determination for success in college, I have every reason to believe that he will give his future residents very productive and gratifying college experience.
