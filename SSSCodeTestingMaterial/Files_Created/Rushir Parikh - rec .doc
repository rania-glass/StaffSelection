In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Rushir for a semester (Fall 2015) as his Peer Leader in Glenn Hall.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Rushir is very connected to his emotions and those of others. He is adept at discerning what a person is trying to communicate, be it verbally or through more subtle cues, and is always eager to help and be of assistance in any way he can. Rushir is very adroit in aiding someone discuss and comprehend an issue they are facing, so that they can more clearly make decisions and weigh options more carefully than they might have considered before.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I have seen much improvement through the past semester in this area, but I feel that Rushir still needs to mature in his delivery of advice or an opinion. On occasion, he may cause another person to feel slighted or speak seemingly harshly, though his intentions are always to help and benefit the other person. He is understanding now the importance of tact in communication, and I am confident he will improve greatly and rapidly in the current semester as well.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I feel that Rushir would be best suited to work with first-year students. His leadership style would be very effective with the new students, and hi is very good at connecting with others on an individual basis. He would be very successful at welcoming the first-year students to Tech and ensuring they have an excellent experience.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Rushir would make a great SSM; he is very thoughtful, caring, and would truly enjoy the good he would be doing, and I know other students would appreciate his work as well.
