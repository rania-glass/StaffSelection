N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been his Peer Leader since August.  

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Cole is very responsible and punctual.  He is in Glenn's Hall Council and is always on top of things there.  He is one of the nicest and most genuine guys and has a great sense of humor, which would translate very well to being an SSM.  He is always helping others with their computer science homework and seems to be great at doing so.  Cole is an all around great person who seems to really care about others. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Cole is a very nice guy, however he tends to be more on the shyer side.  He is one of those people that it may take a while to get to know buy once you do, he is a great guy.  He may need to work on his confidence in conversation, such as when first meeting residents, and be more assertive.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Cole would work best with first years, but I could also see him working with upperclass students.  I think he would work best with students that are fairly laid back, as well as very smart students as he could easily fit in with them.  He would probably work least well with troublemakers as it seems he may struggle to be confrontational sometimes.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes.  He is a great person who would really care about his residents well being.  He would be great at planning events and is a pleasure to be around.  He is great at sports and could really connect with residents of his that enjoy sports, especially soccer.
