Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
I am an adult volunteer with a student organization Kyra is involved with called Cru.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I met Kyra during the first week of classes and have seen her every week this semester through her involvement with Cru.  I have seen her in large and small group settings as well as on a weekend retreat.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Kyra is very responsible and organized.  She came into school with a very clear focus on trying out student organizations and getting involved as fast as possible.  She is both a knowledgeable and friendly person and I believe she would interact well with students on a floor.  I have watched her navigate her first semester as a student with a lot of maturity so I know she would do her best to help other students do the same should she fill a PL position.  She has a lot of drive and her youthfulness brings energy.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Being a 1st year currently, she is still young.  She is also a bit of a perfectionist, so she may be hard on herself.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I can see Kyra working best with first-years.  She would work best with people who are shy, overwhelmed and need guidance.  I would guess she would have the biggest struggle with the students who are apathetic and do not care to respect authority because she is very driven and respectful herself.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I do think Kyra would make a good SSM!  I think she would be successful at taking her personal experiences and helping others walk through them.  She has been a consistent part of community in our organization so I know she values that and therefore believe she would seek to foster that on a floor.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Kyra is a first-year that stands out to me because she carries herself with confidence but is also very teachable.
