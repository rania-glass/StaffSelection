Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
RHA Executive Board liaison

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Brittany for 6 months. I am currently the RHA Executive Board liaison for her Hall Council, and I act as a bridge between her and her fellow officers and big RHA.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Friendly, charismatic, and approachable are the three adjectives that come to mind when thinking about Brittany. Having worked with her for a semester, I have seen her attract people to her hall council meetings with ease. Residents who attend meetings regularly (and there are a fair number of them, especially for an upperclassman hall council) come back because they feel that she is giving them relevant information, she is entertaining, and she encourages community building among the people in her hall council. From her Spongebob meme-inspired emails to her charismatic personality during meetings, she engages residents in a way I rarely see in people holding her same position in other hall councils. She has organized social events for hall councils before, and she is very knowledgeable in various resources around campus, and so I believe she will be very capable of being a resource to her floor as a SSM. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
She is a very others-oriented person; as such, she tends to put other people before herself. There are times when this is a good trait, especially being an SSM with lots of residents. However, there are other times when she has to prioritize herself and learning when to do so is one major area of development for her.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Although I believe she would be successful with any type of residents, I think sheâ€™d work best with upperclass students. She lets other people approach her when they need help, and she presents herself such that people are comfortable doing so. She recognizes peopleâ€™s need for someone to take the first step, but she does not overwhelm you with options. She has the balance of initiating and waiting for people to make the first move, something upperclass students highly appreciate.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Brittany would make a great SSM. Her personality lends itself to being around people and making them feel welcome, which is a great trait for an SSM who wants her residents to feel at home here at Tech. She is also incredibly selfless, always putting other peopleâ€™s needs before her own. Sheâ€™s willing to go above and beyond as long as her residents are happy, even at the cost of her own time or energy. She also has experience being a bridge between a resource and residents, as that is a big part of her work as a hall council officer for RHA. She makes sure residents are aware of where their money is going and what resources are available to them. In short, she has all the makings of a good SSM.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
She has a lot of friends who are SSMs; as such, she has a really solid understanding of what it takes to be a good SSM and what the job looks like.

Would you hire this applicant?
Yes

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
She's worked really well with her residents, with the RAs in her building, with her Hall Director and with the RHA Executive Board, and I see no reason why she wouldn't work really well with her residents and fellow SSMs next year.
