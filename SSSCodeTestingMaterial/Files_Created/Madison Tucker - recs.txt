In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Madison has been doing undergraduate research in my lab since the start of the Fall 2015 semester.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Madison is exceptionally friendly and approachable. I was very impressed that she approached me before her first semester to talk about a research opportunity in the lab. She has been a real pleasure to work with. She jumps in to help with anything that comes up does it with enthusiasm. For example, a critical team member went overseas for the semester abroad program, and Madison, though she was very new, stepped in to do the research activities. She has been such a big help to us in the lab. I would expect the same level of commitment and productivity as a PL. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
None of note. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
My guess is that Madison would work best with most students. We had a discussion about her PL application and she noted that she has experience (as a counselor) working with many types of people to get them involved or help out. She noted that she does especially well with shy people. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, for the reasons stated above. Madison is enthusiastic, responsible, and eager to be involved. She loves the though of being able impact peoples' lives in a positive way.
