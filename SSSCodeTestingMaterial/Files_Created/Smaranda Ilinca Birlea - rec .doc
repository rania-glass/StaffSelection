In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Ilinca has been my resident since August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ilinca is well-rounded and has a plethora of qualities that make her an extremely strong candidate for the SSM position. Through her kind-hearted spirit and approachability, Ilinca quickly built strong relationships with other members of the community. She shows a genuine interest in learning about her peers and remembers specific details about individuals in the community. Ilinca has a remarkable understanding of diversity, and uses her personal experiences to empathize with others.  In addition to Ilinca’s magnanimous personality, she also exhibits focus and drive in her academic studies and extracurricular activities. Ilinca’s ultimate goals are to attend medical school after college and serve the Georgia Tech and Atlanta communities during her time at Tech. She accompanied the Georgia Tech choir at the Catholic Center with piano, she works in a research lab on campus, and she enjoys community service. Ilinca has the perfect combination of work ethic and compassion to collaborate with other SSMs on a staff and develop a close community as an SSM.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Because of Ilinca’s gentle personality, she at first seems quiet and timid. However, in one semester, I have seen Ilinca grow and become one of the most active members of the community. The SSM position would help Ilinca become even more comfortable on campus and in large group settings. I have no doubt that Ilinca would serve her community well and that the SSM position would help her achieve her full leadership potential.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Ilinca would be successful serving either first-year residents or upperclassmen, but she would be more successful in a community with mostly first-year students. First-year students generally require an SSM that is approachable, attentive, and empathetic like Ilinca to help them transition to college life. Ilinca always finds a way to transform a stressful moment into a positive experience and that would help first-year students through their difficult exams and moments of personal struggle.  Ilinca enjoys collaborating on projects and initiatives and works well with others, especially those who share her uplifting spirit and willingness to help others. Ilinca might work less effectively with headstrong individuals who have unwavering opinions, but she would find a polite way to speak her mind and accomplish goals in a group with those individuals.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Ilinca would be an extremely successful SSM, residents would feel comfortable approaching her with questions and concerns, and her staff would thoroughly enjoy working with her. Ilinca is respectful and diligent and would be able to meet her Hall Director’s expectations. She is also friendly and everyone in the community would want to know her and share their experiences with her. Ilinca’s optimism and kindness light up any room that she is in, and her community would benefit from her bright spirit.
