In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been Alexis' PL since August 2015. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Alexis is very personable and down to earth. She’s made an effort to get to know the other girls on our floor and other residents in our area on a personal level. She has previously worked as a camp counselor for special education children; through this role, Alexis has experienced a variety of situations and has been able to develop strong critical thinking and crisis management skills.
