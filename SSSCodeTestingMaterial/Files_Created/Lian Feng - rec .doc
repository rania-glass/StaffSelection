In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known this applicant since the beginning of the Fall 2015 semester. I got to know the applicant very well through out the semester while working with her on group activities in the organization. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
The applicant is very good at understanding those around her and I think this will help greatly form a good community on her hall. She also does a good job at including everyone part of the conversation and making them feel valued. She is a great resource as well thus being a great mentor.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
This applicant will develop a skill of keeping a distinction between professional and personal relationships with her residents. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This applicant will work most well with first year students because of having that bubbly personality that is eager to give back from all she has gained in her first year here.  She will work most well with students who share their experiences back with her and give her constructive criticism. She will work least well with residents who will try to show off and think of themselves as superior to their peers and not consider themselves as part of the community. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes I believe this applicant will be a good SSM because she truly wants to give back to the new freshman that give in and form that community for them that she has found here.
