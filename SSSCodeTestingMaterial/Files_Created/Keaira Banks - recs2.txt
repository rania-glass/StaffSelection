Cheerleading Coach

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have had the pleasure of serving as Keaira's Cheerleading Coach in her capacity as a student athlete since May 2014. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Keaira exhibits the leadership skills necessary to build her team up at practice and on the field court. Outside of these functions, she is very patient, kind, and professional with the fan base and children she interacts with at appearances. I know these qualities will translate into her role as a SSM. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think that Keaira's role as a SMM would enhance the leadership skills that she already possessed by allowing her to set a great example for the students she will be working with. I believe that other students could learn a lot from her in her ability to balance so many activities on campus. Keaira is easily our most well-rounded athlete. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This is a tough question, because I don't think age group would matter for Keaira. She would be great with incoming students because she can share her wisdom about her involvement on campus and her exceptional time management skills. For upperclass students, I have no doubt that she would be great leading them as well, as these would be her current peers. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely. The summary above about what it means to be a SSM encompasses a lot of the qualities we ask of our cheerleaders. We chose Keaira to be a part of our program because we believe she exhibits all of these qualities. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Keaira is very passionate about everything she does. She is involved in several activities on campus, and still manages to be a wonderful athlete to coach and give it her all at practice and games. I am amazed by Keaira's ability to always be positive, even when things get tough.
