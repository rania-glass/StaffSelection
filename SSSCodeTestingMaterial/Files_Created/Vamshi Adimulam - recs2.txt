In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known this applicant from the beginning of Fall 2015. Throughout the semester I got to know the applicant very well through interactions in the organization and have now become very close friends.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
The applicant is very good at having different types of conversations to cater to his audience and this is something I believe that will help him greatly to build that community on his floor that he aims to create. He also takes an interest in knowing about the other person and going out of the way to help them in the most pragmatical way and this is something that his residents can take from. He is also a very pragmatic and logical person so this is something that will help him sustain the professional role of a SSM and also offering credible solutions to his residents. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
The applicant will learn how to encourage residents who are in their own shell to come out and be part of and engage in the community - it is the first step in building the community that will be most difficult for him while working with introverted residents.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This applicant will be most successful with upper class students. He also works well with people who are honest about their commitments, their ideas and feedback while working in a group. He rather have someone tell him that they can't do the job beforehand then flake out at the last minute. He works least well with people who don't own up to their responsibility and aren't organized about it. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe this candidate will make a great SSM because he has expressed his interest in the position to me in such a way that I believe that he truly will care about his residents and making them enjoy their stressful years at Tech through enjoying the programs he puts up etc.
