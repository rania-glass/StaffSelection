I have been friends with Katherine's parents for the past 29 years.  I have known Katherine all her life.  I visited her in the hospital when she was born.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Katherine was born a natural leader.  She stays very active in her family, her school and her community.  She is the type of person that looks for opportunities to make a situation better.   In high school she started a recognition and reward program to motivate students to show good behavior daily.  The program was a huge success.

Katherine is good at motivating others so I believe she should continue to learn new ways to engage and motivate others.  Katherine strives to become a better person and learn a new way to engage others every day.

Katherine is a very fair person so she would work well with most residents (freshmen to seniors).  She does not jump to judgement but listens to everyone's concerns.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do believe Katherine would make a great RA PL.  She tries to engage everyone in the solution when there is a problem.  She listens to all sides of an argument and is very fair.  She does not get swayed easily and stands by her values.  Her family has done a wonderful job of instilling wonderful values in Katherine.  She is amazing.  She is honest, caring and very dependable.  If Katherine commits to something she does everything in her power to fulfil her commitment.  She does not bend the rules because someone is trying to bully her.  She stands tough.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I have always been amazed at Katherine and so impressed with her.  She trully shines as a young adult and has set high goals for herself in her life.  I know she will attain whatever she works to achieve.

She challenges everyone around her to become a better person and contribute to make this a better world.
