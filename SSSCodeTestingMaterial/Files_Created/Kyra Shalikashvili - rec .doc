In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been Kyra's PL since August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Kyra is patient and a great communicator. She has a gentle leadership style which makes her approachable and able to get along with many different types of people.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Kyra could improve upon being outgoing in situations where she feels out of place or like she doesn't know many people.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Kyra would be most successful with first year students, as she will be a second year student next year and able to relate to the first year students. Kyra is interested and excited about the prospect of mentoring students close to her age.   As of now, Kyra works most well with personalities who are outgoing and willing to introduce themselves and start up a conversation. She works least well with personalities who are shy because she is also shy and has difficult being outgoing with people she is unfamiliar with or hasn't yet met. However, once she gets to know people she is comfortable working with multiple personality types.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that Kyra would make a good SSM. She has been present and involved in housing activities, and brings a positive and kind energy to group interactions.
