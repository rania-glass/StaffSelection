In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Nathan has been my resident for one semester.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Nathan is a caring person and very hard worker. He's also a good team player.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Sometimes, Nathan can be very hard on himself and doesn't take time for his emotions. I think he would need to be careful in the position because he would have to learn to deal with both his personal feelings and the issues of his residents.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Definitely upperclass students. He works well with gregarious students and optimistic people; I could see him struggling with students under great deals of strain. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I think he would. He would work hard and do whatever it took to get the job done, which is an admirable quality.
