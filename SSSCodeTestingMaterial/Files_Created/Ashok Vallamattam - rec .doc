In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Ashok since August of 2015 as one of his peer leaders.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
He has a very inviting personality and has demonstrated competent interpersonal skills as seen in his relationships with other residents during his freshman year.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
He would need to develop a bit more in the maturity aspect of his personality. He's not immature, but he is young would need to overcome the lack of credibility that may come with the fact that he will be younger than many of his potential residents.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Given his age, he would work best as a peer leader in the freshman experience program.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
He'd be great at being an SSM. His drive, motivation, interpersonal skills, and work ethic all indicate, at least in my mind, that he would do a fine job mentoring and serving future freshmen. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
He does seem very busy with swimming and other extracurriculars which may pose a problem with the time commitment associated with the peer leader job. Nothing I think wouldn't be able to be resolved, though

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
His maturity is largely a product of his age at this point, but his young age in comparison to other freshman applicants is not the only factor influencing maturity. His maturity levels have the capacity to grow to a level needed to be suitable for the job despite not quite being there at this point.
