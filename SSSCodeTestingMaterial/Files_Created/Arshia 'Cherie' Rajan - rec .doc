For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Previous hall mate

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Arshia for 3 years, our freshman year as hall mates and friends since then.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Arshia is very kind and welcoming. She is very easy to get along with and has a quality that makes you want to talk to her which I think is important when first meeting residents and building relationships.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
While Arshia has a great personality that draws you in, I think she could develop better skills with initiating conversation, she has no issues once they are already started but can be a little introverted initially.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Arshia would work well with Freshman, She is kind and patient and would do well helping students adjust to college. I feel she would work extremely well with more outgoing and open residents and would easily be able to create strong relationships with them. I would say she might have a harder time with more reserved residents or 'ghost' residents with initially drawing them out.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Arshia is a very strong SSM candidate. She is a hard worker, dedicated, and personable. I believe she would has the skill set to exceed in all of the major areas of being an SSM, administrative tasks, duty, and community building, as well as being open to advice to improve and do the best possible job.
