In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
My son and Kaie have been friends for 5+ years. They have been Boy Scouts together. Also, during high school, both young men were involved with marching band and play the clarinet.  

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Kaie Westmaas is an Eagle Scout and as such, has had many opportunities to learn what a good leader can do. Also, within the Pope High School Marching band hierarchy, he served as a section leader and had to encourage and manage a group of clarinet musicians. He is a good listener and leader in my opinion.

Kaie has always been a very hard worker through school and beyond. A position such as this will give balance to campus life and encourage him to get out and have some fun.

Kaie could work with anyone! He is patient and a genuinely nice person!

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think he would be great! He is patient and kind. Kaie has grown so much since high school. He is very mature and serious in how he approaches everything he does.  He has always been a very close friend to my son, always encouraging my son to try new things. I consider him part of our family.
