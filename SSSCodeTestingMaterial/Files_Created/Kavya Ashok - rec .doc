Students' Union President

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Kavya since she served in the Students' Welfare committee during presidency 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
She genuinely cared about her fellow students' welfare and fought for many of them to get assistance as needed from the university fund. She also acted as a counsellor for many students going through a difficult phase in their lives. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
She could potentially develop more assertiveness as seen during her initial time in my committee. She has come a long way since then to be an extremely confident person. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Kavya would be best suited to work with international or students from diverse backgrounds. Many of the these students would be living alone for the first time, and someone like her would be an excellent mentor as she has gone through a similar experience. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. She was one of the few people in my committee who took her job as more than a extra curricular activity and went the extra mile. This is because she sincerely cared about the well being of the students that she dealt with. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Many of the students whom she counselled still went to her for any help on campus even after her term on the committee.
