In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Brooke stayed with me my freshman year at Tech when she visited with the Connect with Tech program. We have stayed in touch since then and she is now a resident of mine in North Ave South.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Brooke Beatty stayed with me my freshman year when she visited Georgia Tech for Connect with Tech. Even as a high school student, Brooke was wise beyond her years and easy to get along with. She is perceptive and can gauge the needs of those around her--a great quality to have as an SSM. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I can honestly say I do not know of any areas of development for Brooke. She is kind, engaging, and thoughtful. She is gentle, and would therefore relate to all types of residents, from shy, reserved students to outgoing ones.     

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
While Brooke would be extraordinary with residents of all ages, she would truly excel with first years. Because of Brooke’s compassion and approachability, she would make so many freshmen women feel more comfortable while adjusting to college. Brooke would work well in the role of a peer leader, for she would be a wonderful resource for freshmen to reach out to whenever they have questions about all the changes that come with college. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
 Brooke came to me earlier this year with the idea of hosting a music night for the hall. She offered to host and play guitar for all those in attendance. Brooke goes above and beyond her role as a resident, She has built residents with many other students on the hall. I can guarantee that the same would be true for her in the role of an SSM.  

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I cannot recommend Brooke Beatty highly enough. She would be such an asset to any staff, and would make for not only a close-knit hall, but would contribute to creating a strong staff as well.
