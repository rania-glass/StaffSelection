In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant for the Fall Semester.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Olivia is so kind and compassionate to all! She is very good at including everyone and is able to listen to anyone. She has organized multiple activities for all of the girls on the floor.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Olivia is definitely an introvert and therefore could develop in the area of being among large groups of people for an extended period of time. I think that if she was paired with a very extroverted Co-PL that her floor would really benefit from the strengths of the two.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This candidate would be most successful with first year students. She definitely has a 'mom' personality and is so kind and caring. She is so enthusiastic, very calm and peaceful, and always has a smile on her face! She would be someone that I would have wanted to have as my PL freshman year! I think the first year students would benefit so well from Olivia's compassionate heart. I know that she would pour her heart into loving her residents and being the person, friend, and resource that all freshman need.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think that Olivia would be an OUTSTANDING SSM. She has such a heart of gold and would be such a good example and role model for a floor. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Olivia would be an incredible staff member and is  able to stay calm in any situation. SHE WOULD BE AN AMAZING PL!
