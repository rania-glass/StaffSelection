In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Rachel lived on 3rd floor Woodruff South (the floor above mine) last semester, and is now a current resident of 2nd floor Woodruff South.  She is very good friends with several of the residents on my floor.  I have gotten to know Rachel very well through conversations with her and her friends as well as through her participation in hall events.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Rachel has an easy-going and friendly personality.  She has an unshakeable sense of humor that I believe helps her and those around her work through tough times, and makes every conversation with her a pleasure.  I believe that her approachability would facilitate trusting relationships with her residents, and that her good-natured sense of humor would help her inspire residents to be optimistic even when classes and campus life prove to be challenging.  I also believe that Rachel understands the importance of facilitating community, which is the primary role of the SSM.  She helped another resident organize a White Elephant Gift Exchange before finals for the residents of Woodruff South that was very successful.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I believe that Rachel would have to learn to temper her sense of humor during some situations encountered by SSMs.  Although this quality makes her a fun person to be around and would be crucial to her success as an SSM, she will have to learn to put on a more serious persona when dealing with duty situations, for example.  However, I believe that she will be able to do this easily.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Rachel would be successful with many types of residents, however I believe that her personality makes her best suited for working with first-years.  She would bring a lot of energy and fun to a community, which I believe is important to help first-year students build a community and work through the stress of being in college and away from home for the first time.  Although Rachel is outgoing, I do not think she is at all overbearing, so I believe that she would get along well with most personalities. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that Rachel's infectious personality would make her a good SSM.  She would bring a lot of passion and energy to the position, which I believe is the most important quality of an applicant.  I believe that she will be willing and able to learn all the other aspects of the job necessary to be successful.
