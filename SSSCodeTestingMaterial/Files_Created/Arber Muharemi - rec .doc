For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
High School IB Chemistry Teacher (3 years) and research supervisor

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Arber for three years. He was a student in my IB chemistry classes from 10th through 12th grade. I also supervised Arber's extended essay research in chemistry for the IB programme.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Arber is naturally meticulous and detail-oriented, and he has experience in organizing and coordinating events due to his management of math tutoring during high school. Arber was also my â€œgo-toâ€ student; if I ever needed feedback on a lesson or insight into how to my students were handling the material, I knew I could rely on Arber for honest, helpful responses. He has a calm, gracious demeanor that puts people at ease; his fellow students could depend on him for advice as well. Arber is academically gifted, but also quick-witted and very funny. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Arber's calmness may initially be mistaken for shyness, but this is not the case. He takes his time observing people, not speaking at first, because he is trying to understand the person before engaging in a conversation. Once he has a good understanding, he is a warm, thoughtful, and entertaining person. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Arber would work well with all levels, but would probably work best with first-years, seeing that he is completing his first year currently. That experience will be fresh in his mind, so he will be able to speak to it with a fresh, positive energy. I have observed Arber working with a large variety of personalities in class and during tutoring, and his diplomatic nature is unwavering. He handles difficult personalities better than some teachers! 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely. Arber enjoys helping others and creating a positive atmosphere for his peers. He is not the over-the-top-aggressive-leader type, but more of a leader-by-example. He was well-respected and liked by classmates and staff during high school, even after four years together.
