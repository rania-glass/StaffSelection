Tessa attended boarding school when she went to High School and I was her Housemother for two years.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Tessa since September 2010. When she attended boarding school I was her Housemother for two years. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Tessa is a compassionate, intelligent, and inclusive young woman. As a member of my dorm leadership team, she could be counted on to reach out to students that needed a kind ear, opened her heart and mind to a diverse group of girls from several different countries, and offer guidance and care. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
She has been a very successful student leader and worked very hard to ensure that the girls in our dorm knew they could count on her in any situation. If she felt that a situation required more than she was capable of handling then she did not hesitate to reach out to her resources. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Tessa is a kind person with an empathetic personality.  She worked particularly well with new students that often needed a guiding hand to help them adjust to boarding school. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I know that Tessa is a fine leader.  On more than one occasion she has gone above and beyond what was expected of her as part of her duties. She has a great sense for the needs of others and works very hard to do what she can to ensure their safety and happiness. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Tessa is an incredible person. She looks beyond herself and her own needs without hesitation. I was very fortunate to have her as a member of my leadership team. The students trusted her and were very comfortable reaching out to her.
