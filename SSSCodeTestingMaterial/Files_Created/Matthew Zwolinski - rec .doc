N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Matthew since he moved into the building halfway through this current semester.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Matthew is very passionate about being part of his community.  He is familiar with the campus, its organizations and events.   We have had multiple discussions about programming possibilities that would be attractive to the graduate population in our area, and he is already working with me to put together some of our early spring events.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think that Matthew would thrive in the SSM role and would gain more soft skills that would be beneficial for his future work in any field that he goes into.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Matthew would work best with upperclass undergraduate and graduate students.  I think that the age difference would make it difficult for him to work with freshmen.  Matthew works best with open, direct people, and may need to work harder to adjust to working with people that use an indirect form of communication.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do.  As soon as Matthew moved into building F he expressed interest in getting involved in the community.  He actively sought out hall council and area events, and has always been eager to participate in events and skilled at coming up with innovative programs that are well suited for our unique housing area.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I have been very impressed by Matthews initiative and interest in housing.
