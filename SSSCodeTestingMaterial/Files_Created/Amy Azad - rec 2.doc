In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Amy since she moved onto my hall in August 2015. I know her pretty well.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Amy is outgoing, approachable, and funny. I think that residents would be comfortable talking to her and going to her for advice. She is also creative and has some good ideas for hall events.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Something Amy could work on is handling criticism from her peers and not taking things personally. I think this applies to the SSM position because sometimes resident's don't want anything to do with you and you have to do your best to not take it personally and try to include them anyways. Amy is working on handling this better.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think that Amy would be most successful with first-year students because she is involved and wants to offer more guidance and help serve as a resource for new students to be acclimated. I think that she would work best with light-hearted personalities because she is a funny outgoing person, but she can also be serious when she needs to.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that Amy would make a good SSM because she is a positive and hard-working person. She would be able to handle her academics, social life, and this job. She definitely has a great presence on our hall and I think she would do a wonderful job in creating a community.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Amy has some good ideas for events. One idea that stood out to me was an event right before bid day to include the greek students in a hall activity. I'm not involved in greek life, but I know it was a struggle getting greek residents who are rushing involved in the hall at the beginning of the year because of all the rush events, so I thought this was a good idea.
