What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Khue is not the most organized (for example I was asked to write this rec less than a week before the due date). She has also slept through classes.

I believe Khue is very versatile and can work with any group of students. I know she would prefer working with first-year students.

I believe with some tips and training on time management, Khue would be AWESOME! Other than that, she is a great applicant and is willing to work with others and values everyone's opinion.
