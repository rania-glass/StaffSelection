Fellow Cheerleader

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
We have worked together on the cheer team since August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
She is very approachable and fun to be around.  She will be able to relate to her residents well.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Through cheer, she is continuing to learn to improve her personal responsibility skills.  I have found she has truly grown.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This candidate would work well with first-years because she is just finishing her first year, so she will be able to relate well.  She works best with outgoing personalities from her experience with the girls on the cheer team.  She would probably have the most difficulty working with rude and bossy residents, since she has witnessed some of that in the girls on the cheer team.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe she would make a good SSM because she is smart and has faced struggles in her first semester that will make her be able to relate to the struggles of her residents.  In addition, she is fun to be around and knows how to make people smile.
