N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Tristan worked as a summer camp counselor at Wahsega 4-H Center. He was hired in January and attended trainings throughout the spring. I supervised his director supervisor, who was the lead counselor. I have known him for 2 or 3 years through 4-H.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Tristan is personable, fun, outgoing, friendly, knowledgeable, hardworking and helpful. He loves a  challenge and works to help others make social connections. He will make an excellent student worker in this position.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Tristan is a logical and linear thinker. He is still learning that many people operate on emotion and intuition while making decisions that are disconnected from available information.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
He will find something in common with most students of any age including very young geniuses attending college or much older non-traditional college aged adults. He can handle a large range of personalities but would probably prefer working with people who are logical rather than emotional.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I do. He will be hardworking, on time, prepared and willing to do whatever is necessary. He can be counted on to do whatever you ask and to take up slack and do more than expected if needed.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Tristan works well with a team and can either lead or submit to leadership. He expects good leadership, however, and will take over if the leader isn't doing their job.
