In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Andreina was my resident for the fall semester.    

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Andreina has many strengths as a potential SSM. She is very kind and compassionate. She makes an effort to get to know other residents and have conversations with them. She was also very active at events which makes me think that she will be great at programming. She is also dedicated to everything she does and will be very dedicated to the SSM position. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Andreina will need to learn how to make sure to take care of herself so that she can then poor into others. This comes with the transition to college anyways. She will also need to learn how to have authority over others even when they're friends. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe Andreina would be most successful with any resident but especially first years. She is an international student so she could work well with other international students but I believe that she would work best with more outgoing residents.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely, Andreina displays all of the qualities I see in a good SSM. She has a great personality and wants to get to know all types of people. I see her working well on a staff and programming fantastically.
