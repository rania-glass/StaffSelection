In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
His immediate supervisor. 2 years.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Geoffrey is an extremely approachable person who has no problem dealing with different types of people. Coming from a multi-cultural background (Born in Puerto Rico), he understands what it takes to effectively communicate with other people. As Head Intern, he was able to clearly communicate with all the regional managers and report back to me with ease. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Geoffrey has always challenged himself to demand more from himself. His constant drive fuels him. As an SSM member, he would go the extra mile. However, he is working on keeping himself grounded and managing his expectations. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Geoffrey would work best with mostly first-years. He has a great deal of knowledge and experiences that serve as a great example for the younger community. He works very well with most personalities, yet he has the most success working with those who can be quite different from him. He understands that everyone works differently and effectively tackles that challenge. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that Geoffrey would make a great student staff member. He has the drive and desire to give back to the younger community. He has a lot of honest advice and knowledge that he wishes he would've had as a Freshman in college.
