In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Andrea for two years. She was my resident for the 2014-2015 Academic Year.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Andrea's strengths are that she is very enthusiastic and personable. Every time I talked to her I felt comfortable and able to relate to her.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As a SSM, Andrea would need to develop her skills as an authority figure. Her ability to make friends easily and bring humor into a situation would be balanced with the administrative aspects of the SSM role.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
While I think Andrea would work well with any type of person, I think she is most suited to being a PL for first year students. She works well with people who are also lively and fun and is able to draw those qualities out of quieter or more reserved people.

I do think Andrea would make a good SSM. Through my interactions with her, I think she would be able to bring a lot of energy and bright ideas to the role and to her staff team. The leadership development of Housing would also be very beneficial to her.
