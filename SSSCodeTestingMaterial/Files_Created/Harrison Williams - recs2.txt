High School Physics Teacher

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I taught Harrison as a junior in Honors Physics, then again as a senior in AP Physics.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Harrison has so many positive character traits, it's difficult for me to know where to begin! He is hard working, trustworthy, honest, and dependable. And what's more, these traits seem to be contagious. He is truly a leader and a positive influence to those around him. Harrison makes it 'cool' to be a good person. Another trait that will make him an exceptional SSM is his independence and resourcefulness. He can 'get around' with little to no help from anyone. He knows the ins and outs of every system, club, institution, or assignment I've ever seen him encounter.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
If this question is asking me to point out his potential weaknesses, I honestly don't think he has any!  ...But if I have to say something, I could point out that he has a fairly demanding major (civil engineering), and if he spends a lot of time studying, that could possibly pull him away from his SSM duties.  But, to offset that, Harrison is extremely resourceful, as I mentioned before.  Being the well-rounded individual that he is, he was always very involved in high school activities, and that never caused any of his duties to be compromised in the past.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I have really only seen Harrison interact with peers his own age, so I'm not sure I can answer this question...  But I will say that he has shown he is mature enough to interact well with his superiors, and gentle enough to guide those who are younger, as well.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I am absolutely confident Harrison would make a good SSM. He is responsible, well-liked, and has a healthy moral compass.  Harrison is a natural leader, an excellent role model, organized, and can be depended on to get things done.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Harrison's father is an assistant principal at the school where I teach. Furthermore, his mom is a permanent substitute teacher for our building. So, not only do I know Harrison in the traditional teacher-student capacity, I know his parents fairly well, too. He comes from a good family, has a healthy family background, and his parents are well-known and respected in the community.  Harrison is a very safe choice for this position.
