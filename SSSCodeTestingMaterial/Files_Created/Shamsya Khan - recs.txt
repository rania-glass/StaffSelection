In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've known Shamsya since August of 2015.  I am her Peer Leader, and we are also involved in the same student organization (SCPC).

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Shamsya is one of the most organized, driven, and responsible person I know.  She is also one of the few people I've met at Tech that never procrastinates, and always gets assignments done before a deadline.  If she is given something to do, she will always get it done promptly, with a high quality at work.  She pairs her determination with a kind heart which makes her a force to be reckoned with.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Coming into college, Shamsya was not aware of the lifestyle many college students pursue.  She is the type of person that leads her life with a strong moral compass, she has never even cussed in her life.  By living her life by such strong moral convictions, I've seen some of her peers shy away from speaking with her or being her friend.  I think an area of development for her will be learning how to be more approachable and relatable.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Shamsya would be most successful as a peer leader.  If she were an RA, I'm afraid she may come off as too timid if she had to deal with a serious conduct situation.  Being older than her residents might give her added self confidence and the natural authority age brings to handle a similar situation.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Shamsya would make a good SSM, however I think she has a lot of room to mature in terms of social interactions and self confidence.  She is the type of person that could take feedback and make changes to grow.  She would do all of her work and assignments and would strive to be the very best at her job.  I think her hall director may just have to work with her in the beginning.
