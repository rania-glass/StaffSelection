In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Siddhi has worked for me as an undergraduate research assistant since the beginning of the summer of 2015.  

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Siddhi has three main strengths as a potential SSM.  Siddhiâ€™s agreeableness and conscientiousness are her strongest attributes.   Sheâ€™s immediately likable and her humble demeanor makes her easily approachable.  This would be an asset in her position as an SSM.  It is easy to imagine a student in need of support feeling like s he could come to Siddhi for advice.  Siddhi is also conscientious about her work.  She has met all deadlines associated with our project and has shown a willingness to stay late in the lab when necessary.  In addition, if she has time conflicts due to other campus events she communicates them early and is responsible about coming in at a different time to complete her work.  Iâ€™d imagine that this is a necessary skill for SSMs, who would have to juggle multiple activities while on campus.  Second, Siddhi has significant experience in student groups on campus.  This would make her effective in two ways.  First, she would be able to relate more easily to a wider variety of students on campus.  Lastly, her experience as the A-town Showdown Events Chair and a Georgia Tech Student Health Services Ambassador means she already has experience organizing events.  No doubt this experience will prove useful in building community among the group of students with whom she is assigned.  Overall, I think Siddhiâ€™s character and personality, her diverse interests on campus, and her experience organizing events make Siddhi an excellent candidate as an SSM.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think the most difficult aspect of being an SSM for Siddhi will be enforcing university policy.  I know when I was an RA at my undergraduate university, this was difficult for most people, myself included.  I could see the confrontational nature of these instances being difficult for her.  No doubt, any training you provide would help her with this, and the instances would ultimately be a growing experience for Siddhi.  

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
In the context of the lab, Iâ€™ve seen Siddhi work mostly with one other undergraduate student and myself.  In both cases, the interaction has been positive and effective.  From this, I can conclude that Siddhi would be effective working with upperclassman her age or older.  I think Siddhi would be effective working with any personality type.  There isnâ€™t any single set of personalities that I think she wouldnâ€™t work well with.  The only time I could see her having trouble is if any resident of hers is purposefully being difficult.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes.  I believe Siddhiâ€™s strengths make her an ideal candidate as an SSM.  Her agreeableness and conscientiousness, her diverse interests on campus, and event organizing experience are all strong assets.  They would make her effective at building quality relationships with other students on campus.  They would also make her a reliable employee.  

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I worked as a resident assistant, the equivalent of an SSM, during my junior and senior years of undergraduate work at Trinity University (San Antonio, TX).  Having that experience gives me insight into the requirements of the SSM job, and how well Siddhi would perform at it.  I believe this is information you would want to consider when evaluating my recommendation.

Yes

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Another trait I havenâ€™t mentioned that should be considered is her academic record.  She has a strong GPA at Georgia Tech and her past performance in high school was similarly strong.  I have no doubt sheâ€™d be capable of handling her responsibilities as an SSM while concurrently meeting her academic and other on campus responsibilities.
