Please indicate what type of recommendation this is:

Your Relationship to the Applicant

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
The applicant is my roommate who has just transferred from UT-Arlington. I have known her for a little under a week.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Shruti is very calm, mature, and understanding of others. She is polite and wishes to be in a position of leadership and helping others. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Shruti is, from what I've gathered in my limited time knowing her, a little shy and timid, so she might need to work on being outgoing and enthusiastic.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Shruti would be good with first years. She can make an impact on them while coming out of her own shell and being more comfortable as a leader. Freshmen tend to need their PLs more than upperclassmen need their RAs, so I think that she would be well-challenged in that role. I do not know how much of an impact or personal growth she would experience as an RA. Because she is new, and therefore a little shy, she could help those in similar situations next year as a PL.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think that Shruti has good intentions and is a very kind and caring person. Again, because I do not know her extensively, I am forced to speculate on her personality.  I think that if she is put in the right situation, namely as a PL and with freshmen who she would have to interact with very often, she would eventually become very open and helpful towards them. So I think she, after becoming more accustomed to Georgia Tech, would make a good PL but an average RA.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
She was proactive in seeking out the application for this position within 3 days of transferring to Georgia Tech, so I think it shows initiative on her part and a deliberate wish to become more involved on campus.

Would you hire this applicant?
Yes, but with reservations

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
The in-person interview would be much more reflective of Shruti's strengths and weaknesses than my 3 days of experience with her, therefore, my recommendation is not a concrete representation of her personality and capability.
