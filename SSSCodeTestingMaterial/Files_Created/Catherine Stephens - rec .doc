In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Catherine as her choir director professor. She's sung in multiple choirs and has been an invaluable officer. Additionally, I assist in her vocal lessons and she just enrolled in an academic class that I teach. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Catherine is one of the most enthusiastic, honest, and passionate students I've ever worked with. As an officer of the choirs, she's responsible for the logistics of the ensemble. She deals with a variety of student issues in this capacity, as well as logistical problems that she must solve. She is pragmatic yet creative in solving these problems. Additionally, she is self motivated--for example she took it on herself to research, acquire money, and purchase new dresses for the choirs. This was no small undertaking as the school had no budget and we had no support for new dresses. She applied for funding and received it and several months after the initial thought, we have new dresses. She is well connected with the rest of campus and would make a wonderful SSM.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As with any student, Catherine's skill set of dealing with life situations will improve as she gets older. This sounds cliche but it's absolutely true in Catherine's case--she sometimes takes on too many projects. She has well meaning intentions, but learning to delegate or pass up potential projects may help her be more successful in the long run. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Catherine would probably work best with underclassmen. Her knowledge of campus and the groups on campus would probably best serve those who have just arrived on campus and learning to deal with the rigors and challenges of college. She is encouraging and can be a good role model for someone who may be overwhelmed in the first several semester of college. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Catherine’s role as a student officer and leader in the Georgia Tech Chamber Choir is superb. As one of the directors of this choir, I work with her on group and individual projects in order for the choirs to run more smoothly. Catherine initiates ideas, completes projects, and communicates to others like a professional. I can always count on her for the smallest and biggest tasks. For example, this spring, Catherine approached me with the idea of replacing 100 choir dresses for the entire choral program. Knowing the limitations of the choral budget, the lack of success in outside funding and support, and the resistance to change amongst the other choral officers, I informed Catherine of her odds but told her to pursue it if she wanted. Several weeks later, Catherine secured funding from several sources for about 90% of the dresses and lobbied the other officers to approve the project. A few weeks ago, the new dresses were ordered and arrived on campus. This is a perfect example of Catherine’s self-motivation, selfless passion, communication skills, and follow-through. Other smaller projects include organizing concerts for small groups, organizing advertising for concerts, arranging transportation for singers, amongst many other tasks. These choral projects, large and small, are entirely selfless and entirely for the success, health, and community building of the choirs.   Catherine is a selfless leader who takes initiative, is the utmost professional, and thinks analytically and pragmatically. She would be a great asset to you—her flexibility and adventurous spirit would serve well in any environment she would be placed. It is for all these above stated reasons that I fully recommend Catherine Stephens for a SSM position.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I also know Catherine’s academic studies through her pursuit of a minor in music. I accompany her lessons and play for her vocal final juries exams. Part of her minor is completing academic coursework and I have worked closely with her with music theory, history, and technology. She is well prepared in her lessons—clearly having practiced and learned her music. She has gone beyond the typical student in music analysis—I often will peek at her choral music and see that she has notated large portions of the music with both harmonic and formal analysis. These analysis exercises are not a portion of the class; however, she is so curious that she voluntarily studies more music than is assigned. These analyses are often tricky, and require critical thinking and interpretation. Catherine’s problem solving skills are clearly well sharpened.
