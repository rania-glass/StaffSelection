What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
#NAME?

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This candidate would be successful with first years and upperclassment; I think she has learned a lot during her first year that she could easily help other incoming freshman. I also believe that she could lead upperclassmen quite well; her ability to form relationships with those older than her is unparalleled. Already in her time at Tech, she has formed a close bond with upperclassmen and graduates at CCF, and when she studies abroad this summer, she will be staying with many of those upperclassmen friends. She is one of the few freshman on my hall that I believe would be VERY successful leading both freshman or upperclassmen. She works well with people with more reserved personalities, as she can bring them out of their shell. She also works well with talkative individuals, though I do not believe she would as much value there, since she may be able to relay as much information in that scenario than in the previous one.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Elyse would make an excellent SSM. As previously stated, her vivacious personality and hardworking yet dedicated spirit would make her a joy to have on any hall as a PL or RA. From what I have witnessed this first semester, she easily forms relationships with others and does not shy away from conflict, an important skill in this role. She is very independent (she was one of the first residents I met on the hall, and on the first week of school, she had already introduced me to many people she had learned from on campus and provided specific examples of things she would recommend for the girls to do on our hall). She genuinely cares about others, and takes into account others' opinions, even if they differ from hers. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Wonderful candidate; she would do a GREAT job! She's been an absolute joy to have on our hall, and she inspires me to be a better PL every day.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Elyse has really grown since coming to Tech as a leader on our hall, and I would love to see her grow more as a leader on our campus. I think she has a great deal of potential!
