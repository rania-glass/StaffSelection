In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant for the length of the Fall semester. Frank is my resident and we have worked together a few times to make preparations for RHA meetings.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Frank has gained valuable experience in leading fellow residents as the president of the Field Hopkins Goldin and Stien Residence Hall Association. He is already familiar with the current concerns and requests of residents and has shown improvement in leadership through the year. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As the area president of RHA, Frank was at first confused in his role. However, through the year, Frank has managed to learn how to lead fellow residents and approach concerns. He is now fluent in his leadership and adept in leading meetings.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This resident will work most successfully with first-years because Frank exactly knows what it takes to have a successful transition from a high school career.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Frank will make a good SSM as he himself is active with community events and a good resident. With a solid innate standard of a good student, Frank will naturally influence and lead his residents to a successful Georgia Tech residence life.
