In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant for approximately 5 months as one of the peer leaders in Howell.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Elizabeth's greatest strengths as a potential SSM include her ability to actively listen and her ability to maintain herself and others, even in a stressed situation. Over the course of this year, I have seen Elizabeth serve as a confident for many of my residents. Others have a natural tendency to trust her and her ability to actively listen to others goes beyond the abilities of some Student Staff Members. Elizabeth also is able to remain poised, even under pressure. Whether personal or public, she continues strong, leading with compassion and empathy.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As a potential SSM, Elizabeth will need to become aware of the resources around her so that when people ask for help, she knows where to point them. This will definitely be resolved through SSM training.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Although I feel confident that Elizabeth would be successful with any age, I feel that her personality works best with freshmen. Her enthusiasm and positive demeanor will mesh well with the incoming freshman.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I know that Elizabeth Ham will make an excellent SSM. She has already demonstrated her ability to communicate and work with freshmen. Her experience in the Grand Challenges program has even further improved her ability to creatively solve problems under pressure. I know that Elizabeth has the qualifications to take Residence Life a step further.
