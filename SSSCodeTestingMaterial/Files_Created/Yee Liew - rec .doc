What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Amanda (yee) is a very creative, outgoing, and caring person who is exceptional at interacting with friends and strangers alike to make them feel welcome and included. She is also great at working collaboratively with others to achieve larger goals as well as getting to know people on an individual, more personalized level.

Amanda could improve on time management and organizational skills. I think that the SSM position would help her learn how to set priorities and manage her time so that she can balance the RA PL duties along with her academic coursework.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This candidate would be most successful interacting with first-year students because she can lead and mentor them as they struggle through their first year at Tech as well as befriend them and encourage them to be involved in the community. Amanda works well with all types of people and personalities the best being open, easy-going personalities and the worst being rude arrogant high-strung personalities.

I think Amanda would be a great SSM because she really cares about people and is willing to invest time and effort into developing relationships. This kind of dedication and a heart for serving would make her stand out as an SSM who actually  gets to know her residents and cater to their needs through her events and interactions with them.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Amanda tends to take on a lot of responsibilities, which sometimes interferes with her academics. However, I think she can manage both the RA PL position and schoolwork if when she is pushed to manage her time better, which she will have to if she is hired.
