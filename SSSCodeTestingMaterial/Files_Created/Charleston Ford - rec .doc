In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Charleston has been my resident for nearly six months in total.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Charleston has always been very willing to help out whenever he can. Any time we need to gather some people for Housing or other things like that, he tries to give support. He also has a very relaxed and friendly disposition with those around him. His sense of humor has been very memorable throughout the semester.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Charleston is not incredibly vocal. Though he is a very unique character and is willing to talk or hang out, he is not usually the one initializing conversation which will definitely develop as an SSM.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Charleston would fit best with first-year students. I have a feeling he works the best with more relaxed students. Though I'm sure he would work fine with higher energy people, he may not mesh as well with such.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do believe Charleston would make a great SSM. Though he is not usually the one initializing conversations, I'm sure it's a skill he will develop through the job. He is a very creative person and I feel would be able to create varying ways to facilitate student interactions in his community.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Charleston has many creative pursuits as a Computational Media major and hobbyist. These will probably come in useful as an SSM for gathering participants and generating activities.
