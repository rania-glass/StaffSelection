In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Kyle since the beginning of Fall 2015. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Kyle is open and amicable; I have often seen him trying to engage and interact with people in a positive manner. I view Kyle as an optimist because he refrains from having or expressing a discouraging mood. These attributes, along with his desire to serve the community, awarded him the position of finance coordinator on the hall council of Center Street Apartments. There he has often helped me with the reimbursement process and provided tips on how to persuade the residents in order to pass a bill. Throughout last term, I witnessed Kyle becoming a responsible officer while maintaining his cordial manner.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
One of the necessary skill of an SSM is to be a effective event programmer. While Kyle has the remarkable experience as a finance coordinator to help organise events, gauging residents for interests and setting up successful events with high attendance will his priority as a first-year SSM.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Kyle has the energy and enthusiasm to become a PL and lead freshmen students, but he is a rising senior. I believe he has the potential to be an RA and build the same community a PL can build.   Kyle is an extrovert, so he is very likely to get along with people who enjoy to share, talk and spend time with others. On the other hand, I know Kyle is also able to spark excitement in others, for instance, he managed to convince all of his very busy roommates to go to Six Flags where they had a wonderful time. One personality Kyle might have a challenge working with is the tendency to be left alone.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
When I get to know my residents, I would also try to determine who can be a suitable SSM. Kyle was one of the first residents I met and he was one of the few who was interested on my concerns and problems. Knowing that it was my first year as an RA, he would attend my mid-week munchies and converse with other residents. He would also show up to hall council events, not as a participant, but as a volunteer, even though his role as a finance coordinator is to ensure the paperwork is in order. I remember him promoting CSA's drink during the Music & Mocktails event, talking to attending residents and preparing drinks at the same time. Kyle wrote me an accolade through 'Of the Month', where residents write about something that made them happy in their residential lives. The text not only motivates me to be a better RA, but shows Kyle's appreciation for the position. All in all, Kyle has the skills and the mindset to be a valuable SSM.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
One major trend in Tech is that students loose their enthusiasm as they progress through school. I saw this through the transition from freshman experience to undergraduate apartments. Kyle is one resident that has impressed me with his activeness. He can provide a lot of guidance with this virtue.
