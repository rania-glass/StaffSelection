In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Jason for 2 year. He was a past resident in my dorm. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Jason is by far the most good-natured and good-hearted person I know. He genuinely cares about the well-being of others and is always willing to put others before himself. In addition to this, Jason is always full of excitement and optimism. He is also very goal and rule oriented and is very skilled in administrative tasks. Lastly, not only is Jason comfortable with working with people form different backgrounds, he embraces such diversity.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Seeing as he has never had a position similar to being an SSM, his main area of development would be in becoming more knowledgeable in the specific duties and tasks necessary for the job. However, seeing as Jason is extremely adaptable and is a very quick learner, I have no doubt that he will not only learn the necessary information, but will also highly excel in the position. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Jason would work best with first-year students. He would work more successfully with open-minded and optimistic people like himself. Jason is able to work with any type of person, but closed-minded individuals might be difficult for him to work with. However, I have complete faith in the fact that Jason will excel in any situation he is presented with. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Jason would make an absolutely fantastic SSM. Not only does he have a desirable personality for the job, but he will also make sure that he excels in every aspect of the job. He is very timely with his work and is very organized as well. Jason would be an amazing fit to any staff he is placed on and will be a benefit to his peers and community as a whole.
