I am Miss Nuthivana's secondary supervisor. She is a student worker in our department (Center For Academic Success) I have known her for eight months.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
One of the very first things this section mentions about a potential SSM is someone who is friendly and approachable. These are two qualities that perfectly describe Navya. Working with over 1000 students a day can overwhelming for some but not Navya. No matter what is going on she great everyone with a friendly smile and goes above and beyond to help them. She is often complimented on her ability to solve problems and how she inspires the students. Her enthusiasm is contagious and these are very important skills to have in the role in which she wishes to fill.

Navya is and can be a  great  leader. She has proven in her current job, that she is dependable and can be trusted. I believe that if given this position she will see just how much of a leader she is. This position seems as if it would make her aware of what she is cable of. Especially being in a position where she has a leadership role.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Navya can work any type of resident. As in her current position Navya interacts with both freshmen, sophmores, juniors and seniors. She knows how to meet the ends of each student. With her knowledge of tech both as a student and student staff member, Navya will be able to take carter to all students. She is just that well-rounded.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I honestly believe Navya will make a great SSM, aside from what I've  mentioned in previous questions, Navya is a joy to be around. She finds the good in people and every situations. If you are having a bad day count on her to cheer you up. She is very respeful not only of adults but also her peers. She brings a sense of calmness to our department and she would be the best SSM you ever  met.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I highly recommend  Navya for this position and know that she will truly be an asset to your department division.
