Robogals Training Manager

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have worked with Ms. Perakis over the Fall Semester of 2015 in multiple Robogals Event.  Robogals @ Georgia Tech is one of many Robogals chapters across the globe. Robogals aims to Inspire, engage and empower young women into science, engineering and other related fields.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ms. Perakis was part of the Robogal training program, which is an essential stage to train our members and support them to grow as leaders capable of teaching the kids in our workshops and events. I have personally taught Ms. Perks, and she impressed me as someone whose capable of learning very fast. In the first workshop for her, she was a group leader and she did her job splendidly. She was able to perfectly communicate with the kids in her group. I remember that the group she supervised has kept up the pace with the progress of the workshop. She also communicated with me as the workshop leader very well, and kept me informed of her group advancement. She was also happy and pleasant. The kids loved working with her. Thus, I believe Ms. Perakis' strengths as a potential Peer Leader are her fast learning and adjustment, well honed communication skills, and her pleasant and positive presence.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
From what I have known about Ms. Perakis I believes she is perfect the way she is. And if any situations arises, I think she would be able to adjust accordingly.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe Ms. Perakis to be capable of adjusting to any type of residents. From my experience working with her, I have seen how excellent she communicated with her peers in the training program, which suggests that she could work with upperclassmen of her age or a year older. I have also seen her work with younger kids in our workshops, and I admired how wonderful she led her groups. Although she did a great job in both scenarios, I think she may be a better fit to work first-years. She would be a great example for them to follow. Ms. Perakis would be the best to direct the new students to potential events, activities, and organizations, and other happenings on campus. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Ms. Perks would be a great choice for a PL position. She has great social and networking skills. She tends to direct people to the opportunities she believes they're fit for. Once she learned what Robogals is about after the training program, she asked if it was possible to set up another program for the girls on her floor.  I told her if we had a good number of interested people, we could. She spread the word and we conducted another training program. That shows how well Ms. Perakis was connected to her community, and how natural it is for her expand it as she was able bring together her floor mates to Robogals. Ms. Perakis is very active and takes her responsibilities very seriously, which would make her a great fit for jobs where she takes the leadership role. Given all that I believe her floor residents would be happy around her.
