In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Lisa Hwang since the 8th grade. Lisa has a exceptionally bright personality and lights up any room she's in. I have personally seen her positively influence first year students during FASET Orientation where her and I served as leaders. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Positive, dedicated and responsible, Lisa Hwang never fails to develop and listen to others while also achieving her Georgia Tech goals. She would truly make a great addition to any staff.

I honestly think Lisa would be perfect for the job.   I have no reservations here. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Although I have seen Lisa work with first years, she has always been mature for her age and can really connect with people of all ages. I believe she would excel in an RA position.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
YES! I believe she applied last year an didn't get the job. I personally believe that Lisa would make an exceptional staff member. She is caring, passionate about helping others, she has personally helped me though really hard times and I think housing needs more people like her.
