In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Milcah for the last semester when she joined our Sorority.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Milcah is extremely outgoing, kind, personable, diverse, and caring. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
While Milcah has wonderful people skills, I think she could develop her interactions with more introverted people. She always has the best intensions but can come off strong.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Milcah would be a wonderful PL! She is very caring and loves to ensure people's success, especially in the form of a leader mentor which I think will be great for freshman residents. As stated before, I think Milcah would have a harder time with more private reserved residents.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Milcah would be a wonderful SSM. She is very responsible and great with people. She is also a hard worker and strives to put forth the maximum effort to ensure a quality job is being done.
