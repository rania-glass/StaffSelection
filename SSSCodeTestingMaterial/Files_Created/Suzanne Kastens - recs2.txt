Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
I am the president of her community service sorority

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Suzanne has been in Omega Phi Alpha for going on two years now. As president of OPA, I have seen her work with others and got to know her personally through those two years.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Suzanne is without a doubt one of most genuine people I know. Though our sorority I have seen her give up her time to not only help complete strangers but also give up her time to help her fellow sisters. Besides her passion for helping others in any capacity she is also known for her time management. By juggling her classes, her leadership roles in OPA and still finding time to enjoy Tech, she has learned how to prioritize and handle all ranges of workload. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Suzanne is very loyal to her close friends and sometimes doesn't branch out to meet other people, I feel that by being an SSM it will help her and her residents gain relationships that both parties will benefit from. She is so willing to help others that using that passion will only expand her desire to make a connection with her residents.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that she would work well with first year students due to her very bubbly and upbeat nature! She is always laughing and smiling which I feel is needed for first years that haven't experienced college much less the Tech environment. She works well with all kinds of people, especially those who get easily excited about things. Even with those who may be reluctant to participate she kindly encourages to try, this has been seen personally many times in group environments and committees that she has belonged to.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I full heartedly believe that Suzanne would make a fantastic SSM. She has the passion to help others with anything, she has the love of Tech to want to make others love it too, and she has the determination and time mangement that all good SSMs must have. She has always been on time with reports and deadlines, as well as always being professional no matter the situation. To me she embodies ALL the characteristics a person must have to not be a good SSM, but to be a fantastic role model for future students.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I think that I have stated how fond and how highly I think of Suzanne. No matter what staff she is placed in she will bring a ray of sunshine to the group as well as a determined efficient mindset. Shes a dime a dozen!
