In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known this candidate for about 5 months when she became my resident. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Amulya's strengths include enthusiasm and bubbly personality. Amulya is the type of person that instantly brightens a room. She actively tries to get to know all of her hall mates, even into the second semester. She is also dedicated to any task that she puts her mind to, such as FSLO. She has proved that she can work well with teams and is able to interact with diverse people. She is also curious, which is great for an SSM, because she will build a bank of knowledge that she can pass onto her residents.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
This candidate can improve on dealing with conflict. I have yet to see her really struggle with people, whether that is because she is a person that is very easy to get along with or just because she hasn't encountered any tough situations that require much mediation. I think that she could improve on her hard mediation skills. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This candidate would be most successful with first-years. She would work best with people that are extroverted, self-motivated, and looking to get involved on campus. She would not work well with people that are more shy or hesitant to try to new things or become involved. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that this candidate would make a good SSM because she brings life to any community. Her enthusiasm and open heart makes here easy to get along with and build a relationship with.
