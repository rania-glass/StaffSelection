In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Perrin has been my resident since August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Perrin is an extremely outgoing and wonderful resident to have. She is sweet and checks up on her hallmates daily. She would make a great SSM because she has a presence on the hall and really makes time to get to know her neighbors.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think Perrin would have to really attempt to learn to juggle the SSM position with school. I think she could do it, but it would be her first major hurtle in the job.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Perrin would do best with very outgoing first-years. She has a lot to offer towards guiding freshmen through what she has just experienced and she has a bubbly personality that would fit well on East Campus. I can't see her doing well in an upper classman dorm hall yet, as I can't see her as someone that people would look up to and respect if they were older than her.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Perrin would make a good SSM, and with the right training, a great one. She has a lot to learn towards commanding respect from her peers, but she has the perfect personality for the job and could get along with many staff types.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I think Perrin would do a great job if paired with a staff with a lot of experience to share. She learns quickly from the example of others.
