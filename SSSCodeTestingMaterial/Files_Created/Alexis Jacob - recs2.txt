In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Since August 2015. I am her current RA.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Alexis is very personable, a strong role model, and has a great sense of humor. It is very comfortable to be around Alexis. She always makes others smile and laugh. She isn't afraid to introduce herself to large groups and plan activities. She goes out of her way to be a mentor to the freshmen students on the hall. She is very active and present in the community - and I believe she would be a fabulous community builder as an RA.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Alexis could develop better stress management skills, but other than that she is a rockstar! She plans programs on her own and she helps out her peers. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
First year students.  She works well with almost any type of person. She is very approachable and friendly.  The type of personality she'd work the least well with though would likely be someone with a never-ending bad attitude.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes! I think Alexis is a wonderful programmer, full of creativity and endless ideas. Additionally she is very genuine and caring when she interacts with others. Many younger students on the floor look up to her as a role model tech student, and go to her for academic advice. She is very outgoing and friendly as well, making her approachable for all.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Alexis has a huge passion for programming!
