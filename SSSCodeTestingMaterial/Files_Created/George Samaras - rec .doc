In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I taught George in English 1101 last semester. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
George is a perfect blend of self-confidence and humility. He is well-liked by his peers and consistently led the class into more productive, generative discussions. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As the son of two professors, George seems to have an innate sense of the university community and how to engage fully with all that it offers. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I never observed George in a situation where he didn't shine. His peers evaluated him with perfect scores after their group research project (perfect scores were rare). George seemed to succeed equally with his first-year peers and with the faculty at a dinner we all attended. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I give George my unqualified recommendation. I can't imagine a better SSM. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
