N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I was Vinny's ENGL 1102 professor; I have known him for 6 months.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Vinny is cheerful, friendly, and approachable. In class, he often lead discussions through careful observations, and was visibly engaged and enthusiastic without dominating the conversation. His classmates enjoyed speaking with him and when he worked in a group with a classmate who was very shy, the other student blossomed and produced his best work. Vinny also challenged the best student in the class - I rarely have students who are able to draw others in and challenge the top students as well. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Vinny could work to express himself slightly more in public - he was always engaged, but he did not always speak up even when I could tell he wanted to say something.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Vinny works very well with his fellow first year students; he works well with shy students, though not personalities who are unwilling to engage. I think he would be happiest working with peers for now and later (when he is more confident) with upperclassmen.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Vinny would make a top-notch SSM. He is engaged and personable, performing this engagement verbally and physically. He works well collaboratively and as an individual, and he's a problem-solver who recognizes when he does not know an answer and knows how to research solutions. He's humble but confident and not arrogant, and I believe his peers see him as very trustworthy.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Vinny is a great young man, and a treasure - he learns enthusiastically and shows engagement. He's a wonderful choice to be a public face and community resource for his school.
