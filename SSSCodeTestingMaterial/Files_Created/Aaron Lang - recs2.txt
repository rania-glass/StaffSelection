Since August 2015

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Aaron is incredibly outgoing and can get along with anyone.  He is easy to approach and fun to hang around with.  He is also encouraging, kind, and polite.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I have observed Aaron continuing to grow in taking personal responsibility over the past semester.  I believe his maturity and personal responsibility will  continue to grow so that he makes a great SSM.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Aaron would be most successful with first-years because he will have just finished his first year, so he can relate easily.   His outgoing personality will also encourage first-years to get involved.  Aaron works best with high energy, positive personalities.  He may not work well with quiet personalities because he may not know the best way to relate to them.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Aaron would make a great SSM because he is easy to get along with and knows how to lift spirits and create a great sense of community.
