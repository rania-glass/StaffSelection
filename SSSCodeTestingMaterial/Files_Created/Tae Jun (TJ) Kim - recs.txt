In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
TJ has been my resident since the beginning of this school year.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
TJ is one of my most outgoing residents. He is friends with neighbors in a nearby apartment, and he has worked to maintain relationships he built last year in his freshman community. TJ has successfully transitioned into his second year as a student at Georgia Tech. He is very approachable and easy to have a conversation with. In fact, he is probably my favorite resident to have resident conversations with. I should also point out that TJ comes from a diverse background, and he will have no problems connecting with a wide variety of residents.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
If TJ is selected for an RA position, he will likely need to grow in learning to build community across several rooms of students. He found it was much easier to participate in community the freshmen halls.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
TJ has knowledge and interest in video games, which is useful for connecting with many residents that may not traditionally be involved in residence life activities. I can see this being especially relevant in a freshmen community.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do believe TJ would be a good SSM. He naturally interacts with other people in a way that makes them feel welcome. He understands what is expected in the position, and is looking forward to learning and growing as an SSM.
