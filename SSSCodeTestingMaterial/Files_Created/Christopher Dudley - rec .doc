In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I am a Peer Leader in the building in which Chris lives, Glenn. I have known Chris for 1 semester now (Fall 2015).

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Chris is an exceptionally resourceful, caring, and passionate, person, which is why I believe he would make an amazing SSM. Chris has an intimate knowledge of Hall Council and RHA, and is always looking for ways to get involved in the Glenn community. He has become close friends with numerous residents on his floor, as well as on my floor and throughout Glenn. I think these people skills, as well as knowledge about residence-life governing bodies like Hall Council and RHA, are essential to the SSM position.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Chris is committed to finding out why and how thinks work the way they do. He is not afraid of getting to the bottom of a messy situation, and proposing a better and more efficient way of doing things. As a SSM, Chris would be able to develop his conflict-resolution skills so that he can get to the truth of the matter in the most sensitive, unassuming, way possible. This is a difficult skill-set to master, but I believe that with a little practice Chris can really excel in this area.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Chris's caring, can-do, down-to-earth, personality would work well in almost any setting. I can see him working with first-years as a PL, because he has excellent know-how when it comes to getting things done in Hall Council, as well as resolving difficult roommate situations. However, Chris's exceptional maturity would also make him suited for a role working with upperclassmen. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Chris would make an outstanding SSM because he is mature and responsible, yet attentive and concerned for those around him. Chris is responsible enough to take the SSM job seriously, but he is also a 'people person' that loves to get involved in the Glenn community. Not only has Chris attended each and every Hall Council session this semester, but he has also passed at least 3 HC bills to enrich the community. One of my favorite was a debate night, where he hosted a Democratic Debate Watch party with pizza and drinks. The event had a huge turnout and got everyone talking about the upcoming election. Chris is also invested in making sure Hall Council procedure is followed as closely as possible. Chris has also started a GNNN (Glenn Nightly News Network) Youtube channel, along with a few other Glenn residents, specifically to report the latest news from our hall. The channel is now very popular and keeps everyone up-to-date with the latest events going on in Glenn, in a humorous light. The social media and communication skills Chris has demonstrated through this project are truly exemplary. Overall, it is clear that Chris has the know-how and the drive to make our residence hall a better place, and I am confident that he will be able to do that for future resident halls to come.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I would just like to share that Chris has helped me grow as an SSM throughout this semester through his unique perspective and commitment to improving the Glenn community.
