What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
?

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I served at an RA in a upperclass hall and I was a Graduate Hall Direction throughout graduate school. Thinking upon my experiences, I think Jessica would be excellent as a first year RA. She is very caring, a good listener, and very resourceful. She has mediated many an argument among our children. I also think she could deal well with upperclassman. I know it can be hard to create community in an upperclassman hall when everyone has usually already created their group of friends, but she is very good at thinking outside of the box and would fill this role well.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Definitely.
