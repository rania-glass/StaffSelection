In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Taylor has been my resident for one semester.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Taylor is great with people. He is very diplomatic and funny and has a good way with others. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
If he were to work with freshmen, I could see him getting a little impatient with them; however, working with upperclassmen would render that issue moot.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
He would be more successful with upperclass students. He works well with outgoing people who are close to him; I could see him having some trouble dragging the more shy residents out of their rooms. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I definitely think he would!

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Taylor has been super involved with Hall Council the past few years, which I think is very relevant experience.
