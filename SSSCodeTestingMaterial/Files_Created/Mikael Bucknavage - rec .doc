In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I am the Technical Director at DramaTech and organization that Mikael is a member of, I also directed the play Othello in which he played Iago. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Mikael is a really good person. He is easy, likable and approachable. He impressed me in his willingness to play the part assigned him and in his embracing the process of mounting our very uniques show.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Mikael sometimes seems more comfortable being the center of attention. While that works out pretty well for an actor, it could be an area of development for a peer leader. With that said, Mikael does work well within a group.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I have seen Mikael work with a diverse group of students from first years through Grad students at DramaTech. Even though he is a first year, his height and confidence make him seem like he has been around GT for awhile. I believe he works well with all personality types.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do believe he will make a good SSM. Mikael, as stated above, is a gregarious. He is easy and approachable and he seems to genuinely want to work with and help others.
