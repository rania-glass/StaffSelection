In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I am this applicant's PL for the 2015-2016 academic year and I have known this applicant since August of 2015. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
This applicant's strengths as a potential SSM are that she is very caring and is known around the floor to be a girl that can help with any issue. She is approachable and is a resident that takes time to meet other girls on the floor and make them feel comfortable. She also seems to collaborate between various friend groups and meet others around the floor. This potential SSM is also very vigilant about coming to events that my Co-PL and I plan. I see her attend these events and meet the learning goal. I can always count on her to be present and well spoken.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Areas that this applicant could develop in is her involvement outside of the dorms. From my knowledge, this applicant is not very involved in other organizations and that could be difficult if she cannot be a resource to all of the future residents. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This candidate would be good for mostly upperclassmen. She is calm and has a mature personality. I think she would work better with upperclassmen.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do believe that this candidate would make a good SSM because she is very focused on making a community. She works hard to make sure that everyone on the floor is happy.
