In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I met Mike last year when I was a PL in Matheson-Perry-Field.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Mike is an avid student who enjoys living in a community. Being such an integral part of the community that I lived in last year, Mike demonstrated great leadership and interpersonal skills. Not only was he part of the community, but spoke up for the community in group settings as well as in Hall Council. He attended most, if not all, of the meetings, and showed passion in representing his floor. Mike carefully reviewed each bill and listened to every discussion in order to seek what was best for his floor and his residence hall. On top of his social skills and passion for community, Mike is an astute and enthusiastic scholar. Joining academic and professional organizations, Mike is always eager to seek new challenges in both his community and academic career. He has demonstrated the most accurate characteristics to that of a student staff member: caring for his community, showing leadership to enhance and enrich his community, and serving as an academic and personable influence to the people around him. Mike's strengths and qualities are what makes him stick out from the rest of his peers, and has shown to be an extremely strong applicant to the student staff member position.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
While Mike is an astute and strong leader, the SSM position can unequivocally help him develop further interpersonal skills and challenge him to initiate events within his community. Being such a heavy influence to the people around him, Mike can learn to yield to his staff members, listening and supporting their ideas and decisions rather than pushing for his own. Additionally, the SSM position can challenge Mike to create and execute his own events within the community, and learn that he can receive support from the rest of his staff members. I truly believe that the SSM position will help Mike in these areas, and Mike, on the other hand, will bring the best of his strengths to his staff.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Mike will work best with upperclass students rather than mostly first-year students. This is because of his level of maturity, sense of professionalism, and advancements in his academic career. He would best work with initiators, maximizers, and challenge-seekers. On the other hand, he would work least well with those who are apathetic and unresponsive.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Mike would make a superb student staff member. Being a peer leader, mentor, and friend to him has given me the privilege to observe strong qualities that fit the qualifications of that of an SSM. As I had mentioned in my previous responses, Mike demonstrates distinct leadership, great interpersonal skills, and a caring heart and passion for his community. I highly endorse Mike as a strong candidate to the student staff position.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I am extremely happy to show off my resident and friend in this application. I feel enthusiastic and passionate about writing this recommendation and would not mind elaborating furthermore about Mike. He is an exemplary student and peer to work with, and I give him my respect for that.
