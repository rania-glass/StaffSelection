Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
When Jordan was in middle school, he was often bullied and called a 'nerd.'  He never shared his 'problems' with his family; instead, he decided to face these bullies himself.  On one occasion, these 'bullies' attacked another student and Jordan knew then he had to get involved.  He intervened, and the 'bullies' backed down.  Since that time, Jordan has made it his mission to help those who lacked the self-confidence or had the ability to defend themselves.  While he was a student at WBHS, he organized a group of young men who raised money for domestic abuse.  With his leadership, this club became one of the most popular clubs on campus and raised not only money for a women's shelter but also awareness of this problem.  As a high school student, Jordan was never bullied and, in fact, was one of the most popular and respected students in our school.  Nevertheless, he never forgot what it felt like 'not to belong.'
