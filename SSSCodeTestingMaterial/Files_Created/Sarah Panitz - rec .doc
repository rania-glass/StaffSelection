N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I had the pleasure of having Sarah in my GT 1000 class this semester and have known her since August of this year. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Sarah is a natural leader and stepped up in this role in GT 1000. She is a person that others look to based on her experience and background. She is optimistic and is focused on getting the task completed but also completed correctly. She's an extrovert and has a wonderful sense of humor. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Delegating Tasks- Sarah is a natural leader but needs to develop her skills when it comes to breaking down roles and spreading them evenly among a group (when needed). She is the type of student who will complete the assignment and pick up the slack when other students drift away.  Learning to delegate in group situations will serve her well as a student and in the workforce. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Sarah works with many different personalities in a successful manner while in my classroom. I contribute this ability to her being from Brooklyn and exposed to different cultures, personalities, backgrounds, etc. Sarah fits into many social situations and adapts well to groups of students as well as individuals. She is  well-traveled and a cultured student. Sarah would do well mentoring and leading  first-year students but could learn a lot from an upperclassman mentor. Sarah would also excel in GT's LEAD program.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Sarah is grounded and approachable. She has the natural ability to be a leader and to influence others. She has ethics and knows innately the right decisions to make for herself and her own personal values. She has a great attitude and positive outlook.  She asks for feedback and help when needed. She's always open for improvement and ways to do processes easier. During the first week of class, it was clear to me, as the instructor that she would be a leader in the course and she proved me right! She is great with one-on-one conversations and  also works well with a group. She has self-confidence and is a trustworthy individual. She will be an excellent role-model for first-year students. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
