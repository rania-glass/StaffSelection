In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been Cori's PL since the beginning of the 2015- 2016 school year.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Cori is a really hard worker and will excel in anything she puts her mind to. She really puts other people forward but is also very dedicated to improving herself as an individual and campus leader.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
She does have some emotional development to work on, but that's something I think can be developed quickly, especially working with other students. As a freshman, it's easy to get overwhelmed with college.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think she would particularly be most successful as a PL (with freshman). She has definitely learned a lot during her freshman year, and she really cares about others. She and I worked a lot this semester on some things she struggled with (picking a major, figuring out her niche on campus, etc) that I think she could really pass on to other students.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think she would make a WONDERFUL SSM. She would be a great resource and a great close friend. With her work ethic, she still excels (she got a 4.0 and grew quite a bit!)

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Cori is a great student and would be a wonderful SSM!
