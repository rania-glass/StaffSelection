She is kind and a good listener. She's would be an asset to your team.

To Whom This May Concern,                                               I know Candice Kaminski to be a cheerful, outgoing, compassionate, hardworking and considerate young lady. Candice and her family live a few houses away from me in the same neighborhood. She has a passion to serve others in her university and community. She demonstrates this by balancing a full credit load of classes this semester at GATech and finding time to volunteer any spare time to help other students on campus daily. She is a selfless person who is genuinely interested in the studying medical profession and helping anyone she meets. I highly recommend Candice to serve as a volunteer PL Residential Advisor for a Hall of Freshman girls at GA Tech.   Sincerely,  Nancy Sickafoose,RN,BSN Ksickafoose@comcast.net

I recommend Candice very highly! She is a terrific, responsible , outgoing and hardworking  student.  She would be a great GA Tech student candidate  to add your Student Staff team!
