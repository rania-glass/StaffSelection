In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Awnish as a son of my friend since Kindergarten (over a decade).

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Awnish has a calm temperament and friendly demeanor that makes very well suited to serve as SSM. In addition, his communication and outreach skills will serve well in reaching out to students who are living independently for the first time in their lives.

Awnish has demonstrated considerable skills in organizing large events in High School including inter-school math competitions and intra-school cultural events.  His other area of development is in working across a range of age groups in putting events together as he has demonstrated when organizing and participating in cultural events in Tallahassee.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Awnish would be most successful with first-years as he has mentoring skills to help them make the transition from a sheltered upbringing to life as an independent adult. He would work best with outgoing students and think he would need to put in more effort to reach out to students who need to be drawn out and engaged. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Awnish would make a good SSM because of his organization skills, demeanor, and calm and engaging personality. Further, his ability to work in a team setting will also be very productive in helping nurture a caring environment at Georgia Tech.
