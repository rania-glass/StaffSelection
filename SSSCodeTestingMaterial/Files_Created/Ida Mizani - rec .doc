For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Ida was my resident last year, so I have known her since August 2014.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ida is an extremely outgoing person. She definitely commands the attention of the room. She is strongly liked by people of many backgrounds, and she is determined to achieve her goals.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think Ida has room to grow as someone who listens. She is amazing at giving advice and even asking for it, but it will be interesting to see how she will grow as someone who provides a shoulder to lean on for her residents.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Ida would do really well with first-year students on East campus. She does well around other outgoing personalities, and I think she would do well in this environment. I can't see her on West campus due to its more quiet nature.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Ida would make a good SSM. She would need some training to make a great SSM, but I can see her being part of a fun and boisterous staff.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Ida really wanted to do this job after her first year, but followed the urges of her parents and did not apply. She has decided that she would still love to do this a year later, and I think FE really made a lasting impression on her. She wants to give back to her community and is truly in this for the love of the job, not the money.

Would you hire this applicant?

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
I think Ida would work well in a staff. Some areas that I have concerns with her are working with residents who are more on the shy end of the spectrum, but I think she would do well if she was paired with a co-PL who was more subtle she would do well. I also think she would be an amazing RA because she could definitely drag people out of their rooms to programs.
