For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
AIESEC Colleague

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been a fellow AIESEC member with Nicolette since September, 2016. We have served on two Organizing Committees together and collaborated on several initiatives for our larger Local Committee. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Nicolette is extremely sociable, funny, relatable, and energetic. She is not only very well liked within our AIESEC chapter, but competent and hardworking as well. She is constantly striving to be inclusive of all members no matter what activity we are doing, and even offered her house to our chapter during our retreat last semester. She is well-rounded and a conversationalist as well, and possesses the rare ability to make people genuinely laugh without being offensive in the slightest.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Nicolette is involved in many organizations on campus and is quite well-rounded, an aspect that I believe makes her easy for people to talk to and quite relatable. However, because she is dedicated to several organizations, she might find it difficult to balance all of her commitments. She has done an extremely good job of it thus far though and was always on top of whatever AIESEC work we were assigned together. I have no doubt that she will rise to the plate to meet the challenges successful SSM time-management will bring.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Nicolette would thrive with first year students. As aforementioned, she is involved with a variety of organizations and activities on campus and has experienced much of what a given Georgia Tech freshman might. Thus, I think she would have helpful advice and experience to offer incoming freshman. She is quite the sociable conversationalist as well, making her a better candidate for building freshman communities as a PL than vying for upperclassmen attention as an RA, in my opinion.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Nicolette would make an exceptional PL. She has been a great colleague in AIESEC and an even better friend to me. I fully recommend her as an SSM above any other freshman I know.
