For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
She was an involved resident in hall council.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Sobia since mid summer, through hall council, her frequent visitation to common rooms, and connection with under the couch (music). In singing group which I used to be in.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Sobia is a unique, self confident person who seems to form organic group conversation frequently. Intercultural feminist.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I do not believe that she has held any particularly large-scale event, so I do not know anything of her logistics ability.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Upperclassmen. While I believe that she would be okay with freshmen as well, her mid-size group tendency would make her a good pl to connect with residents of different backgrounds and to resolve roommate conflicts.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. Trying to force upperclassmen to be involved and happy backfires almost all of the time I've seen it. Sobia starts conversations which grow naturally and usually end with at least two people meeting each other. This is a common occurrence in woodruff. I don't know how she does this, but it is a skill that res life needs more of.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Good singer, member of punk rock band and classical mixed voice chorale.
