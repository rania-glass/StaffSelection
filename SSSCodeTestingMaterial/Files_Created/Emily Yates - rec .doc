N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Emily Yates is my resident who I have known very well since she moved in at the beginning of the year. She comes to all of my events and hall dinners and is an active member of the hall and community, and I have gotten to know her very well over the past year because of this.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Emily Yates is very driven individual. I always see her in the lounge studying for her classes and interacting with other girls on the hall. She is a true part of the community on our hall and is an integral part of the housing events that I put on. In addition, Emily is very friendly and sociable and would make a great Peer Leader as she is good at interacting with everyone on the hall and really made an effort to get to know everyone right from the beginning. She always leaves her door open now and is a great communicator. Emily is also someone who seems very on top of everything and is great at time management. She always gets her work done and helps others with homework and is very organized and on top of her extracurriculars, social life, and school work. Emily is also a very positive individual - a trait I see as imperative in a position such as PL. She has a great outlook on life and a very uplifting personality. Emily is someone who has great leadership potential and could really make an impact as a Peer Leader and Student Staff Member. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Emily has not had any leadership experience at Tech yet, but she was very involved in high school in leadership and extracurriculars. She would also need to develop some skills for planning events, but I feel that would not be difficult for her.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Emily would be great with freshmen. Her optimistic personality would be very good for freshmen coming into Tech, and I feel she would be good at helping freshmen transition into Tech and feel at ease here. She has some great ideas for events and ways to implement her creative ideas into resident life which I also feel would be more applicable to the PL position. I think she would honestly get along with many types of personalities well. She is friends with many girls on the hall from the international students to those in Greek Life and would be able to relate well to many types of personalities. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Emily Yates would be a very impactful and great Student Staff Member. She is someone who would take the job seriously and with her optimism and creativity, I could really see her excelling in the position. She is on top of her work and is also is very sociable and friendly and someone that I feel residents would be comfortable coming to with any problems they have. She is also very hardworking, and I feel she would put a lot fo time and work into the postition to make a community on her hall like the one that we have now. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I feel she would be a great addition to any staff. She is very respectful as well and would make a great peer leader as well as component of a staff team. She definitely has some great leadership qualities but is also a team player that would fit in well with the staff.
