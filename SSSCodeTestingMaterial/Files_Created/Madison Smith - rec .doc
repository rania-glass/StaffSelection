In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been Madison's PL since August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Madison is extremely sweet and personable, and she makes friends easily. She also has a backbone enough to be a strong leader. The combination of these attributes makes her a great leader on our floor who initiates conversations and dinner groups often.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think Madison will have a great time developing into an SSM. She will have a lot to learn about balancing being a PL and a student, but she does a great job of studying in common areas now so that she can balance her work and school hours.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Madison would work well with many types of students. I have only seen her work with other freshmen, but she works well with personalities that are non-dramatic and sensible. I could see her fitting in well with the North Ave Staff or a staff like Brown Smith Harris. I also think she could work well with students who are older.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Madison would make a wonderful SSM. She has her head square on her shoulders and has never caused me a problem on the hall. She is a natural born leader, but also knows how to take direction. She would be a great addition to any staff.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Madison has been extremely open to helping me plan programs and suggesting program ideas this year, so I think she would be great at that aspect of being an SSM.
