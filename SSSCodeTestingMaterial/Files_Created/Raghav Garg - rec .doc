In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Raghav for a semester now. I have been his Peer Leader, his freshman year.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Raghav has been a very sociable resident on my floor. He is liked by his co-residents and his PLs alike. He has always been involved and shown keen interest in all the floor activities. In my opinion, his friendly and amiable nature is one of his biggest strengths.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Raghav has always struck me as being a little introverted and reticent. This could prove to be a shortfall in the role of an SSM, and is an area that he should definitely work on. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Since Raghav has a little introverted personality, in my opinion he would not work very well with people who have a little more aggressive and dominating personalities. He would therefore make a better PL than an RA. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
As I stated above, Raghav is sociable and good at making friends. He is liked a lot by people. He partakes in all our floor activities and shows initiative, if given a duty. Because of all these qualities, I think Raghav would make a good PL.
