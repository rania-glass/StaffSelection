In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known him for 2 semesters (including this one)

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Austin is one of the most genuine and kind-hearted people I have ever met. As a potential SSM his dedication and affection for his potential residents would be beneficial for providing a safe and welcoming environment. As well, his work ethic is great.  I have full confidence that he will go above and beyond to complete what is asked of him and will not hesitate to ask for help from his peers is necessary. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As a potential SSM, not having more than  a year's experience on campus would make it a bit difficult to acclimate to the SSM position while still figuring out academic vs. job balance. In addition to that, without much time under his belt, it would be a bit difficult to be a thorough resource for residents with necessary, however, if need be, I am positive he would be quick to learn the necessary info for the position. I would also say that he would need to develop a stronger leadership presence, but the SSM position does a great job of helping students develop those skills. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that given his age and interests as well as ability to create friendships, Austin would be most successful with first-years. First years, needing an open, and positive influence in order to flourish and Austin can provide just that. In terms of not working well with, Austin is a very social and outgoing person, so he has difficulty connecting with very quiet and shy individuals. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that Austin would make a fantastic SSM. Despite his age, he has proven to me and those around him in our residence hall, that he cares. As an SSM, his caring and levelheadedness are beneficial traits in order to facilitate success in this position. Becoming a SSM, would also benefit him more as a leader looking into the future. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Austin has interest in pursuing more involvement in housing. This year, he focused mainly on his academics this semester, but overseeing hall councils and exploring additional ways that residents can get involved with their own residents halls is definitely something he sees himself doing.
