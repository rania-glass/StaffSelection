In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been Amy's PL since August 2015. I've known her for approximately 5 months.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Amy is extremely passionate, and is willing to go above and beyond for things she's passionate about. I feel like she has boundless energy to contribute to the job.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Amy sometimes has a tendency to become very emotional, and I think she will have to improve in this area in order to deal with potential stressful situations you might encounter as an SSM.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I feel like Amy would work very well with freshmen. She is very good with people similar to herself (slightly introverted, nerdy interests, etc.)

I am slightly apprehensive about recommending her. Her emotional issues could become an issue, but I think ultimately the job would be a good fit for her.
