N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Gabriella is my current resident and I have known her since August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Gabriella strives to do everything she does to her fullest capacity. I have never seen her not smiling, even when coming to me with problems and conflicts in her personal life. She has a deep understanding of how to be sympathetic and empathetic of the people around her, and she is perpetually trying to reach out to people in our community. She attends many of our hall events and has attempted to meet all the people in our community.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think Gabriella can be very outgoing, but will need to learn to stretch herself into a leader on her floor. I think she has an amazing potential to do this, as she fits in with diverse groups of people really well, but leading them will be a new experience for her.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Gabriella would work well with first-years due to her own struggles with the beginning of her freshman year that she worked through. She has a lot of relatable experience that could really help the many freshmen who go through the same things every year.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Gabby would make a great SSM. She really cares about other people and is not someone I could ever see slacking or violating conduct rules. She is an incredible generous and sweet person, and one of the most genuine residents I have ever had.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I really think Gabby would fit in well with many residential areas, but knowing the housing areas, I think she would fit in very well with the Cloudman staff or on West Campus. I think she could work anywhere, but her personality leans towards these areas.
