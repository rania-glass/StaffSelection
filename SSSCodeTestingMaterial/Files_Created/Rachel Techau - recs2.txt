Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
I am an adult volunteer with a student organization Rachel is involved with called Cru.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I met Rachel the first week of classes this year.  She has been coming to Cru for the full semester and I see her every week.  I have spent a little bit of one-on-one time with her, seen her in small and large group settings and have spent the weekend with her on a retreat.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Rachel is very organized, conscientious and responsible.  She stepped up into a role to lead social events for our organization which is a big deal for a first-year.  I believe she would be intentional to plan events to bond her floor and also make sure she schedules her time to be able to be present on the floor as much as possible.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Rachel does not like confrontation and would rather be annoyed than confront an issue.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I would recommend Rachel works with first-years.  Rachel would do best with quieter residents though she does appreciate fun.  Rachel would struggle to work with personalities that are disrespectful toward her.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think that Rachel would make a great SSM in many ways.  She would care for the students and foster a great environment.  I can imagine Rachel being very nervous to confront issues with individuals, so she would need to be paired with someone who can be direct.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Rachel is highly responsible, values community and leadership.  I think she could flourish if given the opportunity.
