In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I first met Milcah during her first semester at Tech, Fall 2015. I was the New Member Orientation Chair for Alpha Xi Delta during her time as new member. I was able to see her on a weekly basis for 11 weeks.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Milcah is an extremely approachable person. She always had a smile on her face and never complained about anything. She could always look on the bright side of everything and be positive in every situations. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think being a PL Milcah would be able to develop her leadership abilities ever more, learning how to organize events, counsel residents in decisions regarding personal, school, and professional life, and expand her relationships throughout campus. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I beleive that Milcah would be great with first-year students. being a first year currently, Milcah would be able to relate to the upcoming first years very easily. As for personalities, Milcah truly can get along with anyone. People who are already outgoing will automatically be drawn to her, but Milcah is very good at working with others who may be more shy and can give them a sense of security and comfort. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Milcah would make an excellent SSM. She is extremely genuine and always kind. Milcah never shys away from a challenge and always gives forth 100% of her effort in everything he does. Milcah is always present and on time. She is always willing to help anyone with anything and will not hesitate whenever she is asked. Milcah loves people and loves helping others. She is a fantastic role model for first years and can show them that Tech is not always so scary.
