In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Kevin for about a year now and have had such a blast in that short amount of time. I worked with his mom before in the Dean of Students Office and knew Kevin before he got into Georgia Tech. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Kevin is one of the most polite, kind-hearted, and hard-working students that I have met so far at Tech. From the first time I met him, I knew that he was going to be something special on our campus. He was so eager to start at Tech and had so many great ideas of what he wanted to get involved in and contribute to our community. Throughout the time that I've known him, Kevin showed his bright personality to everyone he met and actively make it a point to create real relationships with the people around him. I think Kevin would make a great SSM because he is very personable and has the basic skill sets to succeed in this position. He has a bright and caring heart that longs to help those around him and is equally as willing to receive advice and learn from others. I couldn't think of a better candidate to become an SSM and I full-heartedly stand behind him and give my support in his path to the Housing Life.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Kevin, as a first year student, could definitely learn more about time management. Kevin being an overachieving first year, wanted to be a part of every organization and complete every course available to him. Throughout time, he is bound to learn prioritization and time management, and I feel the SSM job would be the perfect opportunity for him to grow in this area. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Honestly, Kevin could probably work with any student yall throw at him! But I know his passion goes into developing relationships with those around him. I definitely see him fitting in with the first years and being able to provide them with solid advice, guidance, and friendship. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Like I mentioned earlier, I could not think of anyone better to join the Department of Housing than Kevin Cheng. He is so generous with his love for people and his charisma and spunk will make it easy for residents to come to him for any problems that they may have. His willingness to help others and seek relationships with them will take him far in this job. I know that he will make an impact on his future residents.
