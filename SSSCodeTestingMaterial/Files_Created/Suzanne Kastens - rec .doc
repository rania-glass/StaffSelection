In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant for one semester. She is my resident in Harris Hall.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Suzanne is very patient and understanding from what I have seen. She is also kind and very easy to talk to. She is orderly and generally very amenable, as well as respectful and professional.. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I could see her having some room to improve in terms of her ability to be confrontational, but this is only because I have never seen her face any serious issue that demanded her to be assertive. For all I know, she could be perfectly assertive when the situation requires, but this is something that I generally see SSMs struggle with.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Suzanne would be good with any kind of student, but in particular I could see her do very well with freshmen. She is kind and fun and would probably plan excellent programs. She works well with outgoing personalities but may struggle a bit more with more shy persons.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I definitely think Suzanne would be a good SSM. She has the demeanor and the patience for the position, as well as a good outlook that I think is necessary.
