In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant for one semester and have been their Peer Leader (PL) for this semester. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Jordan is a very passionate person. He is always involved in the hall, despite having obligations as a student athlete. Jordan has often acted as a role model to others through his involvements, supporting them whenever called upon. Whenever I see Jordan on the hall, I see him making lasting connections with fellow residents and always making their days. Jordan has an infectious level of positivity that is apparent to everyone that interacts with him. Jordan is a kind individual who genuinely cares for the opinions and differences of others, which I believe is vital to the SSM role.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Perhaps Jordan's largest area of difficulty as a SSM would be juggling his responsibilities as an athlete and a SSM. However, he has remained heavily involved on our floor and I firmly believe he will be heavily involved as a SSM, despite his athletics commitments.

I believe Jordan would be most successful with first-year students. I believe Jordan would work well with all types of personalities, as Jordan is an individual who strives on diversity and utilizes it to promote community and communication. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I firmly believe that Jordan would make an amazing SSM, due to his passion, dedication, and all-around kind and supportive nature.
