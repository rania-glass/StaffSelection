Friend

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
As friends since the beginning of the school year.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
 She is very agreeable, playful, and has an affect on others around her that makes everything more fun. She also has a lot of leadership strengths as she has been on a basketball team for a long time and led them to win the title as the MVP. She pushes everyone else to be the best versions of themselves by leading as an example which in turn leads to an idea of unity among her team or community. She has an amazing work ethic and is very dedicated to her responsibilities and those around her. In addition to this, she goes out of her way to help others, as shown by her help with special needs kids. She is selfless and cares about others genuinely and will not hesitate to help. She is very empathetic and very understanding with a great ability to appreciate where a person is coming from. Since she can easily put herself in other peoples’ shoes, it makes it very easy for her to relate to other people and coming from many different backgrounds.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Sometimes when she gets burdened down with work, and because she is so dedicated she can become a little more secluded in order to catch up.  

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Kate would work really well as a PL and working with freshman. As stated above, she is quite social and has led a team before as the MVP. Similarly, freshmen will often times look up for an example to follow and someone to take advice from. She can appreciate others’ backgrounds so a PL position where respecting and building community and making the transition from being in high school to college and levels of maturity would be a great asset.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes I believe Kate would make a great Peer Leader for all the reasons I have stated above. To hit some highlights though, she is agreeable, sociable, team player, natural leader, respects others and commands respect, genuine, caring, and sincere.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I think that Kate would work really well with every aspect of this job. I think she would work really well with an HD, get along really well with the other PLs and make a great team environment, and of course the residents would really look up to her and she could easily build a friendly environment.
