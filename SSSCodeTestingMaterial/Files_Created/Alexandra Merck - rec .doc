In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I employed Alexandra during her senior year of high school at my Kumon learning center. (2014-2015) Throughout her employment at my learning facility, I personally trained and guided her in her position as a teaching assistant. She became an important member in my staff as she was consistent in her attendance (3-4 days per week) and proved potential in her abilities through managing her responsibilities in a way many others could not.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I have many expectations for my staff, and Alexandra exceeded, if not exemplified to others, the roles expected of an assistant. She played a pivotal role in hundreds of students' learning in the way she communicated clearly their needs to her supervisors and parents, managed her time efficiently, and presented herself as a caring, concerned member of our staff. She was able to multi-task despite the high volume of work depending on her.   Having dealt with students, ages 4-16, as well as their parents, I have no doubt that Alexandra is an individual who has a special leadership ability no matter the circumstances. I am convinced that she would be an excellent addition to the Student Staff.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Of course, with her many strengths, it is foolish to say that one has no need for improvement. The first few months of her employment, Alexandra received my requests and constructive criticisms with such optimism and an open-mind. I saw many of her weaknesses grow to become her strengths as her time with us came to an end.  Time and feedback is a huge factor in the work that I do. I will be happy to see Alexandra develop her ability in concision, which she has improved immensely on from the start of her employment. It is an important skill to learn in life as well as a potential SSM. In guiding fellow students, Alexandra may not have the time she desires to bring influence to her peers. Through finding the brief words and actions to be all the powerful will be a great asset to her in the Student Staff. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Like I mentioned earlier, Alexandra has worked with it all from young students (just out of diapers!) to difficult teenage students who have yet to find their passion to overbearing parents expecting to see the impossible become a possibility. I think I can most see Alexandra make the most difference among the underclass students, her own peers. Her confidence and drive is evident in the way she completes any task. Among fellow assistants who were of the same age during her time working for me, I could see that Alexandra's voice was valued and her opinions mattered.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, Alexandra will make not only a good SSM but a valuable one. It is not often that I praise my previous employees- Alexandra being an exception. She will always a special ingredient in a large crowd through her contagious personality, refusal to accept just an 'average,' and openness to learn and grow.
