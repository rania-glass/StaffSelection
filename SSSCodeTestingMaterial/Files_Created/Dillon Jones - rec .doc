N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I serve as President of a community swim team. I have employed Dillon for two summers: once as a junior coach and once as our team's head swim coach. Our team has 130 swimmers for which he is directly responsible for and must report to the Swim Team Board. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Dillon has a strong work ethic and is very comfortable working around others. He has supervised 7 other swim teach coaches, including personal friends. I was amazed at the way he was able to lead peers without conflict. He was clear with his staff of his expectations but was also able to encourage them to have fun when appropriate. It is not common for someone of his age to be such a natural leader and have the ability to balance personal relationships with work expectations. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Dillon expects perfection from himself and I would anticipate that any situation he was unable to resolve would seem like a personal failure.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe Dillon would be able to work with most any group. I have seen him work with teenagers, young children, same-aged peers, and then be able to turn around and meet with parents. I do not anticipate that there would be any group at Tech that he would have difficulty with. I think he would thrive with freshman simply because i think that he seems to do well in the 'big brother' or 'experienced leader' role. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely. I have watched Dillon grow and mature since he was in middle school.   He has excellent communication skills with peers and adults. I feel confident that he would be able to interact successfully with residents, his supervisors, and reach out for support from administration as needed.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
As a faculty member myself, i realize how important it is to get the right person into the right role. Dillon is drama free. He is reliable, dependable and mature beyond his years. I entrust a 130 member swim team to him. He has ALWAYS been on time (actually early), he communicates with me professionally, and keeps me up to date on personnel issues, etc.  I think Ga Tech was fortunate to get Dillon as a student and i think that having him represent the school to residents would be an extension of his Tech experience. He would be a true asset to any program he is connected to. Sharon D Swift, EdD OTR L ATP Director of Student Affairs College of Allied Health Sciences Augusta University (formerly GRU)
