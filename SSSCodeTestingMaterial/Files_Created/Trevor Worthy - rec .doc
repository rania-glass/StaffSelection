In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Trevor is a resident of mine and I have known him from freshman move in. I almost also the Team Leader for the GT 1000 section in which Trevor is in. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Trevor is a very charismatic person. He has a big smile and uses it to his advantage. It makes people like him very much and allows for him to be successful. Trevor is also very honest in his work. He shows strong leadership in group projects and makes sure that his ideas are known as well as taking into account the ideas of other. In addition, Trevor is very good at taking charge when he needs to. He has a good sense of situational awareness and adjusts himself to each situation. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Trevor needs to work on his visibility. I don't see him on the floor as much as I would like. Trevor can also be very quiet in new situations, something that would be helped through the SSM process. I believe that Trevor would also benefit from the creativity that the SSM role demands, as he can sometimes lack the ideas needed to succeed in certain situations. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think that Trevor would be best suited to work with first year students. He provides a strong role model to follow and even for myself, he inspires me to improve as a student staff member. He works very well with people who are more reserved, like himself. He finds the ability to relate to them and also push them to the best version of themselves. He works least well with people who disagree with him on fundamental issues, as Trevor is very passionate about everything he does. He gives 100% to everything he tries. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think that Trevor would make an excellent SSM. He pushes others to improve themselves. He also has a certain quality that makes him easy to believe in. Trevor is very good at following guidance while also incorporating his own ideas on how to do things. The weaknesses that Trevor would bring to the job are very small and few. I believe that any time Trevor is faced with a situation where he is not completely equipped to deal with it, he tries his best and also works to improve himself in the process. Trevor would be an excellent choice for the SSM position.
