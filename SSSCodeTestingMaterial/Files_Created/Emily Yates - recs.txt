Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Emily is part of the campus ministry that I am apart of and help to lead.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Emily for 6 months now. She has quickly become very close to me and my family.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Emily is very personable and approachable. Having been a PL in my undergraduate career, I know how important it is for your residents to feel safe with you. She is also kind, energetic, and a lot of fun! Her bubbly personality would cultivate a sense of community on her floor as each resident would quickly feel close to her.  Being from out of state, I think Emily can help other students who are adjusting to being away from home learn to deal with that transition.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
She, as any other freshman, has to continue to grow in her discipline in juggling her academics and other extracurricular activities. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think she would connect most with incoming freshman. Although she is still growing in juggling many things at once, I can say she has had success in this area in the past semester. She is also extremely enthusiastic about what she does and would do an incredible job at guiding her residents through their first year at GT. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes because the strengths she has will help to build community among her residents while her personality and transparency will help each resident to know they have someone to talk to if needed.
