Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Nevi was a Peer Leader at Morristown High School. I served as one of her advisors.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Nevi for over three years. As previously stated, I served as one of her Peer Group Connections advisors. In addition, Nevi was a mentor for Spanish speaking students and  a member of the golf team. I was fortunate to serve as her advisor and coach in both of these ventures as well. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Nevi is a responsible, organized and outgoing individual. She finds it easy to communicate with people from all walks of life. As  a member of Peer Group Connections at Morristown High School, she emerged as a strong leader and mentor for an extremely diverse group of Freshmen. She effectively planned and implemented activities to facilitate their transition from middle school to high school.  Nevi has an engaging manner and people find her easy to talk to. She is an active listener who responds well to constructive criticism. She is the ultimate team player.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I really don't see any areas of weakness in regards to Nevi's ability to handle this position. She has the ability to adapt and be successful in any situation.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Although I am certain that Nevi would be successful working with any demographic group, Nevi would be a fantastic Peer Leader for the first year students. Her experience working with Freshmen as an upperclassman at Morristown High School will make her an invaluable commodity as a Peer Leader at Georgia Tech. There is not a group that Nevi could not work with, but I believe her greatest strength is her ability to engage and support younger students.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I have no doubt that Nevi Shah will be a great SSM. Nevi is passionate about helping others, she is a skilled communicator and collaborator, and she has had success leading similar ventures in the past. I cannot think of anyone who would do better job for you and your program.
