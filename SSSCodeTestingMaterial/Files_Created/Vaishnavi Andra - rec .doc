For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Vaishnavi (Vaish) since the beginning of the fall 2015 semester and am her RA.  I have gotten to know Vaish very well through conversations with her and her friends, as well as her participation in hall events.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Vaish is a natural leader.  She invests a lot of energy into her relationships with her friends, and I believe that she would be able to apply her value of strong relationships successfully to the SSM position.  I see her organize outings and events and study sessions with her friends, all without seeming overbearing.  Because of this I believe she would be excellent at developing community on her floor.  Her natural leadership style and friendliness make her highly qualified for the SSM position.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Vaish is highly confident as a leader, but I believe she would need to emphasize collaboration as an SSM.  Teamwork with staff and residents alike is crucial to success as an SSM, so Vaish would have to work on relinquishing some authority to leverage the strengths of her team.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Vaish would be most successful with upperclass students.  Vaish's maturity and confidence would allow her to work with residents and staff older than her without any problem.  I believe that Vaish works well with most personalities.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that Vaish would be an excellent SSM.  She is confident and sociable, and puts high value on relationships with others.  I believe that this would lead her to create a strong community on her floor.  Vaish is unique in that she has a friendly yet no-nonsense personality.  I believe that this combined with her maturity and confidence would allow her to handle crisis situations with great skill.
