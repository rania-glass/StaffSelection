In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Benjamin has been a graduate student working under my direct supervision for several years.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Even among GT graduate students, Benjamin is unusually intelligent and organized. He is also mature and thoughtful, and is very much a self-starter. I am confident that he is deliberate and wise in his decision-making abilities, and that he would work sensitively and respectfully with others.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
He has a charming Chilean accent. His English is excellent and -- as someone with a foreign accent myself -- I wouldn't change a thing about his. But perhaps he might wish to.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
He would be successful with any rank of students but if I had to choose, I would say upper class undergraduates first, graduate students second, early career students third.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes! He has a cheerful personality and a good sense of humor. He is kind and thoughtful. He is mature and hardworking. He has a passion for college life. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Not only would I hire him, I have! I'm not sure I've ever had a brighter, warmer graduate student -- and many are now faculty members at top-notch universities.
