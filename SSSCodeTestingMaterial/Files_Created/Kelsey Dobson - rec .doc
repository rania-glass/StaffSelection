In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
We lived on the same hall last year. She was also on hall council with me last year.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
She is very organized and dedicated. She always puts 100% into whatever she does. She is also good at planning things since we worked together on hall council. She is very positive and friendly. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Not much. The only possible area of development is putting herself  out there to things she wouldn't normally do. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
She would work well with first years, but she would work better with upperclass students. She works well with everyone although those that slack off can get her frustrated. But she never shows it if she is frustrated. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. She would make a fantastic SSM. She has the organizational skills and planning skills which was evident when she was Vice President on her freshmen hall council. She is very easy to talk to and can read people very well.
