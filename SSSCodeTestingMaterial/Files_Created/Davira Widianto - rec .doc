In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've known Davira since she began working as a PLUS Leader in the spring of 2015.  In my role, I hire, train and supervise all of the PLUS Leaders here at GT.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
She is one of the most likable people that I've ever met.  She gets along with everyone and has a fantastic work ethic.  She always completes her logistical duties early, and is always helping out her colleagues whenever possible.  She is very friendly, compassionate, and approachable, but has also been able to set firm boundaries between herself and the students.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Asking for help when needed.  I could see Davira overworking herself instead of reaching out to her supervisors.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
She has worked mostly with incoming freshmen in her sessions, but she also collaborates very well with some of our junior senior PLUS Leaders during trainings and events.  I've observed her working with a student that was very disengaged (on his phone, not paying attention, etc.) and she was able to break out of his shell and join the group.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely!  I plan on bringing her into a leadership mentor position within our program as well.  Davira's motivation and energy get others to want to follow her.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I cannot recommend Davira highly enough.  She's fantastic to work with.
