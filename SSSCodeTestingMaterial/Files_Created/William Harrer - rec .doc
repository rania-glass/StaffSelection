What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
William is an absolute joy to be around--his positive demeanor and attitude is infectious to those around him. In addition, he is a hard worker that leverages his skills and talents to help those around him. He's a natural-born leader who is personable, fun, but can be serious to get the necessary work done. He is also I've seen both of these facets of his personality through being his mentor in the Honors Program, but also being in a class with him.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think one area of improvement would be in logistics and planning details. I also think that this is something that can definitely be learned, but something he's not fully experienced in doing yet.

I think he could work with both upperclassmen and freshman with ease--WIll is the type of person who would be able to take charge of a situation if given the tools, but he's also fun to be around and works well in diverse environments.

I believe that this person would make an EXCELLENT candidate. From his work and leadership in the Honors Program, he rises to the occasion in any scenario and  naturally takes the responsibility to be a good influence on others.
