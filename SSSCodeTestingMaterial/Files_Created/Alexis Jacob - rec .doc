Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
She is part of the Executive Board for the Pre-Dental Society.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Alexis for a little over a year now. We've interacted through a couple of classes taken together and also through our time on Exec together.   I would like to note that I am writing this recommendation as her 'current supervisor' and not has a SSM. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Alexis is a strong willed, passionate, and an extremely bright individual. Her intelligence is unmatched but there is also a quirky fun side to her that you wouldn't have guessed could come out of someone like her. She cares very deeply for her academics and for the people she is surrounded by. Through my interactions, I could see how much time she would put into helping someone in need. She has a strong sense of justice and tries her best to uphold her morals values. Alexis can bring so much creativity to this job and to her residents. She has a way of seeing things like no one else is viewing them. I believe this stems from her passion and pure talent for art and drawing. Side note: She is an amazing artist and her work should be displayed in museums! When Alexis is given a task to complete during our Exec Meetings, she is always so prepared and gets the task done without hesitation. Her work is impeccable and most always, she'll go above and beyond what is asked of her. And above all, her willingness to sacrifice her own desires in order to help others is a defining trait that will make her a great SSM.   I full heartedly give my support to Alexis as she applies to be an SSM. She is honestly one of the best people that could be applying this cycle. If you have any further questions, or I can help explain more about Alexis, please reach out to me. I would be more than happy to spend my day talking about how great Alexis is!

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Alexis could improve on her ability to not put so much pressure on herself. She takes her job and academics seriously - which is not a bad thing at all! But often times, she will put so much pressure on herself that she ends up not being able to see the bigger picture of everything. I know that being an SSM will be a challenge that she is capable of taking on and learning from. Housing could definitely help her see the bigger picture of a situation. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Alexis would work well with any type of student! But I definitely see her working more with first year students. I believe that my answer in number 9 fully details her personality traits that could help benefit the first years. But to recap, Alexis is one of the most hard-working, caring, and dedicated students on this campus. It will be hard to find someone who is so willing to give her all to the residents. She is open in a way that makes you feel comfortable to talk with her about what's on your mind, and allows herself to be readily available to anyone who is in need of a chat. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. 100% yes. Through my experience with her on Exec, I know that she is so dedicated to her work and will give her all to this position. She is not your typical 'yell loud and be crazy' SSM, but rather one that is more reserved, but equally as tenacious and passionate about her work. She is going to make a great addition to the housing staff!

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I full heartedly give my support to Alexis as she applies to be an SSM. She is honestly one of the best people that could be applying this cycle. If you have any further questions, or I can help explain more about Alexis, please reach out to me. I would be more than happy to spend my day talking about how great Alexis is!
