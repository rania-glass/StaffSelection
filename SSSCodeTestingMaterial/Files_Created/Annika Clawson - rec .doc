In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I met Annika when she was accepted onto the Freshman Activities Board. I have worked as her Sophmore Advisor specializing in Internal Relations and Individual Student Growth. I have gotten to know Annika very well and have learned a lot about her leadership style and passions.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Annika is one of the most caring people I have ever met. She is incredible at conflict resolution simply because she genuinely wants the best for every party involved. Her organization skills are impeccable, and she has the perfect balance of fun and professionalism.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
When I first met Annika, she had little confidence in her own ideas. It's been incredible to see how just a few months in a leadership position among her peers has forced Annika to grow and know when her ideas need to be heard. I feel like being a SSM would continue to help Annika grow even further in this area, which would be amazing because she has some of the best ideas when it comes to event-planning.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Annika is typically called 'Mom' amongst her peers simply because she has the same nurturing personality you would expect from a parent. I feel this is a great example of why she would be best at working with first-years. She would be the guidance many first-year students need in this time of their lives. Annika has one of those personality types where she can work with nearly anyone. The possible issue I could see is if someone was constantly mean for no reason, but I feel she of all people would be able to find a resolution to that.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I give Annika my highest recommendation for SSM. She is incredible. She's someone who is going to have such a positive influence on campus and work so hard to create a positive, loving atmosphere that we so badly need at Tech. She makes me want to be a better person, and that's the best kind of leader there is.
