Nick is very positive and professional. He is always excited for classes and is very responsible but he is also very fun and light-hearted

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think as an SSM Nick will learn how to better communicate with different people and will grow as a person through the residents he interacts with. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
