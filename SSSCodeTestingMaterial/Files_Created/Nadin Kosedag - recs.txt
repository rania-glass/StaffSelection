In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Nadin Kosedag for over four years. She was a day student at Darlington School who became a dorm leader in the boarding program. Nadin mentored first year girl  boarders, ages 14-15. As a day student leader she was responsible for not only connecting the dorm and day students, but also supporting the 9-10 grade boarders throughout their first year at Darlington. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I think Nadin's greatest strength is her ability to listen to her peers, give them the support they need and at the same time hold them accountable to the community's standards.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Nadin does not always see her strengths and does not recognize the positive impact she has on others. Because of this she does not always congratulate herself. Instead she analyzes what more she could have done in the situation.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Nadin was very successful with our first-year boarders. Her warm and welcoming personality puts new students at ease. She is also very good at talking to parents and answering their questions. Nadin is approachable, helpful and nurturing. She will do whatever it takes to give them a start that points them in the direction of success.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. In addition to all the traits I have already listed, Nadin is a hard worker. She will not do anything half way.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Nadin is not a quitter.
