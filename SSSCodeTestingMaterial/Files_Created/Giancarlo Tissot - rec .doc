In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've been the applicants PL for 5 months.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
The candidate is very mature, respectable, and easily garnered the respect of everyone on our floor very quickly. He has great interpersonal skills, and is able to communicate very well with people of all personalities. He also has planned and lead several events.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
The applicant has functioned in many ways, but I feel as an SSM he might need to take a more prominent leadership style, but I have no doubt he is capable and up to the task.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
The candidate would work best with first years, as he really helped with the enthusiasm on our floor and lead the charge to explore campus and beyond. He works well with personalities of all types, and does not have issues working with any type of person.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, due to the traits I described above, mainly his maturity, and great interpersonal skills, and I have no doubt he would function as an effective PL.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I had a resident that I had trouble reaching out to, who had been getting into trouble, and this person was a great resource and displayed his concerns for the student to me before I had even known he had been getting into trouble. He only wished to help, and asked how he could do so, and he really helped me handle this situtation.
