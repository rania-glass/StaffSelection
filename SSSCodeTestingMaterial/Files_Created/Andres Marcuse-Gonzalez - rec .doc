Schoolmate

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Andres and I are enrolled in the same 5-year BS MS in International Affairs program. I have known Andres since freshman year and now we are both seniors.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Andres is an incredibly strong worker and is able to multitask in stressful and strenuous situations. This past semester, Andres has been a full-time student while interning part-time at the Carter Center and has succeeded tremendously in both roles. Since I have known him, Andres has worked while taking classes, but he has never let his busy schedule get in the way of his academic success. Andres is also an Ivan Allen ambassador and is a great mentor for high school juniors and seniors interested in the Ivan Allen school of liberal arts. Andres has also spent a semester in Chile and his family is from Venezuela so he is extremely comfortable in culturally diverse environments.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
The SSM position would allow Andres to further develop his tremendous leadership skills and it would allow Andres to grow in more areas than areas pertaining to international affairs and liberal arts as these have been his areas of involvement thus far. The position would allow Andres to become involved in other areas of campus, areas in which I have no doubt he would succeed.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Since Andres is becoming a graduate student in the fall 2016, I have no doubt he would work greatly with graduate students and upperclass students. Andres works best with involved and outgoing personalities with very strong drives as he likes to be challenged constantly.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Andres would be a wonderful SSM as he is everything I think an SSM should be: a mentor, a friend, a leader, and someone who is always there. Andres would no doubt be dedicated to the role as he dedicates and exceeds in all areas to which he commits. He always finds time for everything and everyone and he never completes tasks in a halfway kind of manner. He always gives 100%.
