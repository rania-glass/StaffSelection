In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
As the VBS director, I have know Giuliana for 4 years. As a student of Religious Ed I have know Giuliana for over 12 years.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
One of Guilianaâ€™s best qualities is her ability to jump into a situation and take over when needed. For example, Giuliana has often been required to take over the instruction of a lesson at a momentâ€™s notice with little or no warning. She is confident and creative with a natural talent to teach and lead.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Giuliana is a confident, personable student leader who would be the perfect candidate to help incoming freshman to spread their wings or  open up to all the challenges of living away from home. She is open and friendly to all people, both students and adults.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Giuliana is so open and friendly to everyone, I find it difficult to think of anyone who would not benefit from her friendship and guidance. To my knowledge I have found no one who would have trouble communicating and relating to this industrious creative college student.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Giuliana is an enthusiastic, creative leader. She relates well with all students but is especially gifted with creative, outside-the-box students. She is energetic and puts more into every situation that is generally required.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Despite her age, Giuliana was totally accepted by the students and adults as a major leader in every encounter I have experienced with her.
