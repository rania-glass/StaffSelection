For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Fellow Grand Challenge Participant and Floormate

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have know Benjamin for almost 3 years. I met him in the Grand Challenges Program during my freshman year and have been in several classes with him as well.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Benjamin is one of the most driven students I have met. He was actively involved in Hall Council and Floor events in the residence Hall. He is extremely approachable and would be a great role model for residents as he has had experiences as a Co-op and with research. As a current SSM, I feel that Benjamin inherently has what it takes to succeed as a RA PL. His ability to calm tense situations and the confidence he brings to his roles would make him an excellent SSM.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Benjamin can really benefit from the SSM position as it can accelerate his leadership development. He has been developing his leadership skills with positions in organizations and through his Co-op but I feel the SSM position would help give a different side to his leadership.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Benjamin would be most successful with first year students. He is the person who loves working with younger students as a mentor and with freshman I feel he would naturally be able to guide them through the hurdles of Tech. Benjamin works well with all types of personalities. I have observed him in teams, interact with many different kinds of students with various backgrounds and he has gotten along very well and very effectively with everyone.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I strongly believe he would make an excellent SSM. I recall one instance during freshman year when there was a big argument on the floor about noise disturbance and everyone's tempers were flaring. Benjamin calmly stepped in and with a few quiet words and some jokes he managed to alleviate the situation. I firmly believe that residents would really enjoy having Benjamin as their SSM.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Benjamin is a very well traveled person and is knowledgeable about various cultures. He would work well in the multicultural student body that Tech has.
