In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Bintou for about two years. In 2014, we were coworkers at Six Flags over Georgia. Now, Bintou is a resident in Hanson. Not only is she a resident now, but she is also one of my coworkers at the Alumni Association. As a resident and as a coworker, I truly know Bintou, her work ethic, and I believe she'd be a great SSM.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I think Bintou is definitely a good communicator and she has the ability to speak with others effectively and efficiently. Working in the Alumni Association, Bintou and I have to communicate with alumni for a series of events, and she consistently does an excellent job at work. I also think Bintou is very kind spirited and has the ability to make connections with almost anyone. I think both of these qualities are extremely important for the SSM position because making connections with residents (especially freshman residents) is extremely important for their success. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think being an SSM would help her develop her leadership skills. Being a leader in life is very important, and I think the position will help her develop her leadership capabilities. Although she might not always express her leadership qualities, I have seen them here and there in the work place. By becoming an SSM, I think she will be able to fully blossom into a leader. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Bintou would work well with first year students. She is familiar with Freshman Experience and getting involved with freshmen activities. I think she would very easily be able to connect with a group of freshmen residents and share her own experiences to help them get through their first year as Tech students. Although I think she would be best with first year students, I think she would also be able to do well as an RA with upperclass students or even exchange students in I-House. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Bintou would be an excellent SSM. She has a wide range of skills that make her very qualified for a position in the Housing Department as an SSM. She can communicate well, she's relatable, a hard worker, very reliable, and an overall qualified candidate.
