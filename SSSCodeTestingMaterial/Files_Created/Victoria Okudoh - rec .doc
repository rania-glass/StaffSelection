What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I am not sure what to say here, since I m not very well familiar with what a SSM must do, but I expect that she will need to help people deal with personal challenges caused by class stress.  Perhaps she should take a short class on this.

First years-- and especially those who have transferred in from another school, since she has personally had to deal with the challenges that this impose.
