Josh is fun and gets along with pretty much everyone on the hall. More importantly, while Josh in involved he is frequently around the hall which helps builds community.

There are no major areas of development for Josh. I would say that his room ( a quad) is often messy but I am confident he will have a cleaner room and as a result, a more welcoming room for his future residents

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
First years would be his best. He would work well in a traditional FE housing on east because he is social and enjoys meeting new people. He would work the least well with upperclassmen and grad students.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. Josh would be a good SSM because he is social and has a solid base. He understands how to get his work done but also enjoys having fun and likes mingling on the floor. He is someone everyone will like and would be a great addition to any FE staff.
