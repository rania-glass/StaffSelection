For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
I taught Chase for 3 years in high school, and sponsored clubs he was in.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Chase was my best physics student (awarded) the first year I had him.  Then he had me for the two year IB Physics sequence.  Again, he was tops, getting high scores for the year on the IB exams.  He is ethical, fun, has a warm personality, likes people.  People like him.  He achieves at high levels, and has a high capacity for projects.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Conscientious, smart, warm and sociable, practical-minded, complete and thorough, strives for excellence without being a perfectionist.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Chase is strong all around.  I think he is a great match for this job.  I do not see weak areas.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Chase would do well with most college students, and major, any gender, any level, any socioeconomic background.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes.  He has the rare combo--the focus, logic, and mental toughness of an introvert, and the warmth and connectedness of an extrovert.  He takes direction well, listens, understands, humbly presents a better way if it appears to him. He has the ability to see the big picture

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Again, one of my best students of all time.  He cooperates well with others.  He was a boon to the clubs he participated in.
