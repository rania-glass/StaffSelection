Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Director of the GT Honors Program (Alex is a member of the Honors Program).

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I came to know Ben, first, by reputation. I was seeking a team of Honors Program 'All Stars' who would serve as excellent ambassadors in outreach informational sessions with potential GT applicants and others. When I sought recommendations from Honors Program staff in September of 2015 (when Ben was a first-semester freshman), Ben was on the short list of Honors Program students recommended to me. Since I first reached out to Ben last September, I have interacted with him at outreach informational sessions and in preparing a joint proposal in December 2015 (with other Honors Program students and me) to present at a USG conference (to be held in Athens in April 2016) on 'Best Practices For Promoting Engaged Student Learning'.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ben has a kind of gentle, deep strength of character that impresses people shortly after meeting him. He is, at the same time, very friendly and approachable, very proactive and enthusiastic about doing great and fun things, and also a person you would naturally go to for help and support.  He genuinely cares & respects others and is really dedicated to stepping up and playing a leadership role in fostering community, 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I have not observed anything in Ben that I think would need to be developed for him to excel as a PL. At first meeting, Ben may seem a bit quiet & reserved, but this impression is quickly revised as soon as Ben starts to talk & act. I think that, very soon after meeting him, his peers would appreciate all the strengths described in Question 9, above.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Ben seems to get along with everyone--and impress them quickly--so I don't think he would have any problems connecting with any students. At first impression, perhaps some students would think he is not outgoing and fun-loving, but I think they would soon appreciate his many facets (including being outgoing and fun-loving!)

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Ben would be an excellent SSM. He is very mature, responsible, thoughtful, and dedicated to the GT community, and has all the strengths and qualities (as indicated in answers to Questions above) to make an excellent PL.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Ben is someone who is very enthusiastic and goes the extra mile in whatever project he takes on. When I was putting together a joint proposal for a presentation at the USG conference on 'Best Practices For Promoting Engaged Student Learning,' I sent out a request to my student team asking for any input or suggestions. My request went out on the Tuesday of fall 2015 finals week at 4:41am--with a note appreciating that the timing of my request might make it difficult for anyone to give any final input. Ben (who was very enthusiastic about the opportunity from the get go) got back to me with comments (at 9:30am!)--and very cogent and useful comments, which I incorporated in the final proposal.
