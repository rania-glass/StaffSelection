Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
I was the tennis coach @ GWHS in Denver where Lily attended, and I was her coach for two years.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Lily was a player on the tennis team that I coach.  I have know Lily for two years.  During the her senior year she was team captain.  

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
In her tenure as captain on the tennis team, Lily was well like by the other members of the team and was well respected.  She was quite organized and carried out the duties I required in timely manner.  I intentionally teamed her with a freshman since she had the maturity to act as a 'mentor'  during their doubles matches.  One of the duties she had was to plan team activity (e.g. spaghetti dinner) Also, Lily is quite intelligent and well spoken.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
This is a somewhat difficult question to answer, knowing that over the course of her freshman year I would guess that Lily has grown.  Yet as a senior in high school knowing her on relatively limited basis I considered her a well rounded individual. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
One of the reasons I paired Lily with a freshman was her empathetic  nature.  It was a good pairing.  In my experience with her she seemed to be able to work with all types of 'personalities'.  The type of person I would imagine is the most difficult is someone who is not focused or disorganized.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes I believe that Lily would make a good SSM.  She is organized, empathetic, enthusiastic, flexible and focused. Still she is a relatively easy going and likable individual   

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I really don't have a great more to add.  I think this would be an excellent opportunity for Lily that she will grow from and give her an opportunity share her experience to assist GIT students to also grow during the course of the year.
