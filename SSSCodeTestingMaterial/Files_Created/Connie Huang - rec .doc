In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Since the beginning of the academic year, through RHA, various official and unofficial meetings.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Connie is a socially minded person, but not very outwardly so. She has a wide variety of interests which may better allow for her to connect to more reserved people organically. Naturally self-improving.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
She seems to excel in one on one communication, so large groups all at once may initially be a challenge.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Connie would work well with somewhat socially minded upperclassmen, or more reserved freshmen.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. Being able to include residents frequently left out in the housing model is fundamental to a healthy community. Works fantastically with teams.
