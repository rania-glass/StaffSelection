N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Tessa is one of my residents this year and a member of the Grand Challenges Service Committee, which I chair. I see her every day in the hall and 1 evening a week additionally because of the service committee. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Tessa would be a good role model in how she balances being on the crew team, hall council, academics and service. She is driven by a sense of duty and has been one of the most committed members of the service meeting: she has attended 90% of meetings this semester and provided good feedback at these meetings. Tessa is also supportive of her community: she submitted a bill to get cooking baking supplies for the whole floor to use after several of the girls complained about not having a set of dishware to share. Because of her involvements across campus, Tessa has the background knowledge to be a great resource about places for her residents to get involved on campus. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Tessa looks at and uses her phone a lot, especially during large group activities. During service meetings, I have been afraid that other members may feel like she is not paying attention to them, but she always jumps right back into conversation (somehow pays attention to both) and no one has expressed concern about her phone use being a deterrence during meetings. Regardless, it may seem rude or distracting if she were to use her phone while talking to residents. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Tessa does not have the most energetic or creative personality, so she may get worn out by expending energy and creating programs that interest upperclassmen. I would recommend first-year students for that reason, but I could see her working with upperclassmen as well. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Tessa could make a good SSM because she has a calm personality, a wide variety of interests to share, and has the good of the community in mind. She would be more successful partnered with an older SSM who could guide her and help her break bad habits like excessively using her phone.

Would you hire this applicant?
Yes, but with reservations

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Tessa definitely deserves an interview to assess her inner passion for the position. A hall director would have a better perspective of whether her personality would fit well for their staff.
