In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
For three years, I have served as the applicant's manager at the CRC. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Sunatthacha is a very energetic person. She makes all tasks, even the most tedious and boring ones, quite enjoyable. She has a great personality and a can-do attitude, ready to serve in the best way she can. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Sunatthacha is blossoming into an all around person. Under the tenure of having her as an employee, I have seen huge growth. At first, she was very timid and did not take on tasks unless she was told to. Now, she leads all tasks and takes charge for things that need to be done. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Sunatthacha would be great with any residents, but she would be especially great with freshman. Her energetic and  approachable attitude would make freshmen comfortable in asking her questions. Sunatthacha works well with any personality type except maybe someone who is hyperactive. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
In my opinion, Sunatthacha would be great for this role. She embodies the term student leader and could help so many through challenging circumstances. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
One thing that I have not mentioned is Sunatthacha's passion. As her boss and a boss of 30 others, I can not give individual one on one time to all of my employees. But I have personally seen Sunatthacha step in and help a struggling fellow employee, he would be a wonderful addition to your team.
