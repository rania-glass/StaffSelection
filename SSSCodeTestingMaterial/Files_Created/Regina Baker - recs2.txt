In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Regina for about 5 months when she became my resident. Our relationship started from eating at the dining hall together to impromptu conversations in the hallway.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Regina is skilled at seeing a project through. When she starts something, she is determined to finish it. She is also passionate about a variety of things, making her relatable and easy to talk to. She is also hilarious in a way that only Regina can pull off, which makes her easy to approach. She is also creative, artistically and conceptually. Regina has proved that she can come up with unique plans and has the ability to carry them out. She is confident in herself but also isn't afraid to ask for help when she needs it. This, in my opinion, is an excellent quality for an SSM candidate because it is a position that requires a certain level of knowledge but also the ability to continue growing and learning. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Expanding her experiences. Regina is involved on campus but I think that as a potential SSM she has the ability to gain new insights from new experiences that are vastly different from the ones she has already had. Another area of development could be working in large groups and being able to voice her opinions in a group setting. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This candidate would be most successful with first years because she works well with both introverted and extroverted people, although she is more of an introvert. She would be great at bringing a diverse hall together. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that Regina would make a good SSM because she is the type of person that is willing to put forth the effort to create a community. She has fully embraced the Open Door Policy and has built several relationships with people on the hall. She has already planned a formal program, created the advertisements, and purchased the supplies with the help of only another resident. She is also genuinely kind. She never fails to ask about my day whenever I see her and actually cares about my response, practicing active listening. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Regina is truly one of a kind. She is a pleasure to have as a resident. Her knowledge spans over various subjects and she never fails to surprise me. As an SSM candidate, she has a lot of space for growth but the potential is there.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Regina may come off as shy at first but once she comes out of that cocoon, she blossoms into a butterfly. She resembles Ferb from Phineas and Ferb. She might not talk all the time, but when she does, you know that it is worth listening to.
