In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Giuliana is my resident and she also lives in the room next to me so I've gotten to know her very well. I have known her for a semester. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Giuliana is very friendly and has a happy disposition. She is also responsible and organized. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I would characterize Giuliana as an introvert and interacting with people in large groups can be challenging for an introvert. However, she would do really well making one on one connections. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Giuliana would be an amazing PL. She's a very caring and helpful person, which would make her perfect for the PL position. It is harder for her to work with loud, bubbly people, however she has never had any problems getting along and working with others. She is most comfortable working with others who are more introverted like her. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Giuliana would be an amazing SSM. She is such a warm, friendly person and has a way of making people feel happy and comfortable. If I were a freshman I would love having her as my PL and I think future freshmen would agree.
