In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I taught Spencer this fall, 2015.  He enrolled in my service learning English course, ENGL 1101 The Art of Advertising.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Spencer is a strong leader; he is diplomatic, confident, outgoing, approachable, and he displayed these skills in my course serving as the team leader.  All semester long, he led a team of seven individuals through an advertising campaign servicing the Atlanta Beltline.  He volunteered for this high-profile assignment and his team coordinated a fantastic effort on behalf of the client.  Spencer navigated the challenges of working with a real-world client during his first semester of college with grace and determination.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
One thing Spencer reflected on after his semester-length assignment was the need to continue developing proactive leadership skills.  He grew in this area over the semester, and I feel he is poised to push these skills farther in this new role.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Spencer is an easy going individual.  He would be an asset to young students who are just becoming acquainted with the Georgia Tech community and campus.  I think he would enjoy the challenge of working with upperclassmen, and he would grow from that experience as it would stretch his confidence and leadership skills.  But he would do well with all personality types as his work exhibited last semester.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Spencer would make a great SSM.  He is kind, motivated, confident, and easy going.  He is looking to expand his leadership potential, but he genuinely likes people.  

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I am happy to expand on Spencer's qualifications further if needed.
