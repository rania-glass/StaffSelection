In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Lily is one of my residents, so I have known her since the beginning of the fall 2015 semester.  I have gotten to know Lily through conversations with her and her friends on the floor, her participation in hall events, as well as through planning a hall event together.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Lily is approachable and friendly, but her greatest strengths as a potential SSM are her passion and creativity.  Lily and several of her friends approached me with an idea for planning a Woodruff South White Elephant Gift Exchange before winter break.  I helped them brainstorm and offered to support them by providing refreshments, but they took the lead with the event.  Lily worked with her friends to make decorations and a holiday 'photo booth,' advertise through fliers, and even create a playlist of holiday music for the event.  Turnout was high, and the event was fun and engaging for all who participated.  This event took a lot of time, and demonstrated the energy that Lily would bring to the SSM position.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Lily's bubbly personality makes her fun to be around, but I think she would have to learn to put on a more authoritative persona when handling duty incidents, for example.  However I believe she would be able to learn this quickly.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Lily would be most successful with a first-year community.  I think her energy for the position would be put to best use with first year students who are often more willing to engage in the residence hall community.  Lily works well with all personalities.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that Lily would be an excellent SSM.  I believe that Lily would be able to organize fun, creative and engaging events and leverage these to build a strong community.  What most impressed me with the event that she organized was that she worked closely with her friends to make it happen.  This demonstrates a leadership style that emphasizes collaboration, which is critical to the SSM position.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Again, I highly recommend Lily for the SSM position and am confident that she would be very successful in the role.
