Colleague

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I met BenjamÃ­n in the fall of 2012 when we began our physics PhD program together. Since then, we worked together closely for hours on end through many difficult physics problems. Further, I have worked with him in an academic environment as a TA. Finally, as we grew closer, we began to be close friends as we met (and befriended) each others' wives, parents, and siblings. I consider BenjamÃ­n to be a close friend and formidable colleague.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
BenjamÃ­n is nothing if he is not brilliant. As I have worked with him, I have learned about his many qualities that would make him an ideal SSM. BenjamÃ­n has a great set of ethical standards. Despite his soft-spoken demeanor, I have witnessed times when he has challenged someone on their ethically dubious viewpoint. He is capable of holding intense 1-on-1 conversations by asking deep, insightful questions and truly listening to the responses. Finally, as an international student, BenjamÃ­n has had to navigate the dangerous waters that comes with being a non-citizen. This means that he can always identify the appropriate campus resource for nearly any problem! He would truly be an asset to any SSM team.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
One of BenjamÃ­n's strengths is also his biggest weakness. As a more introverted type, he is also more comfortable in small group settings. Unfortunately, the SSM job requires one to sometimes lead large groups of people. While I am fully trusting in his ability to learn and adapt to that situation, I have never seen BenjamÃ­n interact in that capacity.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
As a married graduate student, BenjamÃ­n is clearly suited best for family housing. BenjamÃ­n is deeply thoughtful and insightful. He is quick to think and slow to act. As such, he is best suited by the many personalities that are found in family housing.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
BenjamÃ­n would make a terrific SSM. He is the kind of leader that would excel in family housing. His attitude and personality are in perfectly matching stride with the vibe of the community. I know that he is completely capable of fostering community, adding value to the resident's experience, and making an impact on his community.
