Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Both dancers of GT Insaafi

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant for about 1 year now. We interacted through dance which can be anywhere from 7 hours a week to 24 hours a week depending on the competitions we attend. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I feel that Siddhi would make a great addition to the student staff because she has the determination and creativity for the job. She is willing to build a community and learn the common interests between her residents. She is a responsible individual that is  concerned with safety and the professional aspect that this job requires. Based off my interaction with her, it is evident that when she is given a role or responsibility, she sees it through 100%. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Siddhi has great interpersonal skills and leadership potential. However, when it comes to developing further potential she sometimes displays signs of less maturity(in a fun character type of way) and lower motivation. She has the voice to show self confidence but sometimes she needs the extra motivation to successfully complete her task. These are things she can improve upon and things that will become apparent through SSM training. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Siddhi would be great as an RA who deals with upperclass students.  She has the skillets and the campus experience to help with upperclassmen especially in terms of providing resources for jobs or handling situations involving things like stress. These are all factors we learn during training but Siddhi already has such experience which is invaluable. Siddhi is a people pleaser and will do whatever she can to help others. Her creativity could be used to find ways to bring upperclass residents out which is something that most RAs struggle with. She works better with outgoing and charismatic people but she can adapt quickly to anyone especially those in her community who she would be interacting with more frequently. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I feel that Siddhi would make a good addition because she makes people comfortable when talking to her. She also makes an effort to get to know others. She has the ability to manage as a leader and delegate efficiently as I have seen her do in the past.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Siddhi is one of the hardest working people I know. I don't doubt that her values and personality won't transfer over if she is to become a SSM.
