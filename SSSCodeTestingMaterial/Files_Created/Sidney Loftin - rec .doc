For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
1 year as her cheerleading coach. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Sidney is extremely personable with the courage to speak up, uphold our program's values and to connect to her peers. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Like many young people at Tech, Sidney will further hone her leadership skills. She already has inherent fundamentals - interpersonal skills, strength and courage - and when she emerges as an SSM she will be able to put those into a leadership role and really make an impact. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Peers and first years. Many of her peers look up to her for the qualities I mentioned above. She is very social and personable and could see her greatly benefit first-years in particular, getting them to draw out of their shells. However, I see through cheerleading that Sidney can connect with anyone - the 2 year old fan or the 90-year old GT donor! 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely. Sidney is extremely outgoing and social, and is used to collaborating and being part of a team with Georgia Tech Cheerleading. She is already highly visible as a cheerleader which could add to role. She is well-suited for leadership with strong interpersonal skills.  

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I recommend Sidney for this position as  I feel it falls in lock-step with who she is and how she is already involved with Georgia Tech. I am excited for the ability for Sidney to touch many more students.
