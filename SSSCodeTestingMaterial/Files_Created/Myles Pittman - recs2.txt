In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I was Myles's RA during his freshmen year in Woodruff North for one year. So I have known him for a total of a year and a half now.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Myles is a motivated, driven guy who has the potential to be a great RA. It is easy to like his goofy, funny demeanor when you first meet him. His friendliness and openness to others is his greatest asset when it comes to the SSM position.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think that given the opportunity to be an SSM would be a great learning and growing experience for Myles. It would help him develop responsibility for others and organization and people skills.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think he would fit well with upperclass students because of the more hands-off role of an RA when compared to being with first years. I would say that he works well with outgoing personalities naturally and that working with more introverted or quiet individuals will be a good challenge for Myles.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I do think that Myles has a lot of room for improvement and that the role of an SSM will challenge and allow him to grow into the position.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
He was definitely one of my most memorable residents!
