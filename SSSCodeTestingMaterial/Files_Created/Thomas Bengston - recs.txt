In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Thomas is a resident on my floor, and I have known him since August.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Thomas is driven and follows directions, making him an ideal employee for any supervisor. Immediately upon arriving at Tech, Thomas inquired about the position and how to make himself a competitive candidate. Under my guidance, Thomas applied to freshman leadership organizations, ran for hall council officer positions, and introduced himself to our hall director. Given the instructions and resources to succeed, Thomas will take them, execute, and get the results he is looking for. As an SSM, Thomas will be inquisitive and set high expectations for himself.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Thomas is eager and tends to move at a fast pace. At meals with his floormates, Thomas will eat quickly and leave very quickly, and he is not usually willing to hang out until everyone finishes and is ready to return. Though he has good intentions, either to exercise or study, the SSM position can be unpredictable. He may get a knock on his door at an inconvenient time and Thomas will need to understand that he must be flexible in this role. With the right guidance and clear expectations, Thomas will adjust accordingly. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Thomas will work well with upperclass students. He will do well balancing the administrative and relational aspects of the position. Thomas will work well with down to earth individuals. He is easygoing and will enjoy a staff and hall director that is laid back and flexible. He would work least well with individuals who are impatient - Thomas is inquisitive and eager to learn.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. Thomas will be an excellent staff member for any supervisor. He takes guidance seriously and will strive to be the best. He has a fun side as well, making a humorous video when he ran for hall council, so Thomas has a creative side that will serve him well in developing a community. Thomas will be a great addition to any staff and will be respected by his residents.
