In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've been Nevika's PL since August 2015. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Nevika has a very bright and outgoing personality, which combined with her ambitious nature, make her a natural leader. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Nevika's personality can at times come off very strongly, which could be difficult for quieter residents. Nevika is also heavily involved in other organizations, which do not leave her with much free time; this role could provide her a venue to work on her time management skills. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe Nevika would thrive in any community she is placed. Due to her personality and extracurricular commitments, she would most likely be a better fit for a east campus staff. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
With training, I believe Nevika could become a good SSM. She has the foundation in all the required and helpful skills, but I believe they could use fine tuning.
