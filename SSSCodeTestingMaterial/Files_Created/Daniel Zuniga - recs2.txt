In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been Danny's Challenge Counselor and PL. I have known him for 2 years. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Danny is always the type of person to bring fun and excitement into anything that he does. He would be able to relate to a large variety of students while also being able to be a role model to them. Danny's administrative skills are top-notch and would not only excel in the informal responsibilities of the role, but will also be a strong advocate for the rules and regulations of GT Housing. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Danny is overall a fantastic candidate. Seeing as he has not had a position like the SSM role before, he would just need to become more knowledgeable of the requirements and duties that he would have to have. That can easily be accomplished through training. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Danny would work best with first year students. He would mesh well with open personalities. Danny is able to work with any type of people, but difficult and closed minded individuals might be a small challenge. However, I have no doubts that he would be able to successfully work with these types of people. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Danny would make a fantastic SSM! He is a great-natured guy and will be an amazing assets to whichever staff he works on. He cares about people and their overall growth and will put forth the necessary effort in order to excel at the position,
