Please indicate what type of recommendation this is:

N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I was Ji Eun's RA and suite mate last year (2014-2015) in Woodruff.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ji Eun is a friendly, outgoing individual who immediately got plugged into our floor community last year in Woodruff. She is willing to try new things and has a unique background as an international student from Burma that I think will bring a fresh perspective to any potential staff she joins.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think that being an SSM would give her the opportunity to learn a lot about leadership since she hasn't had much experience in the past. From interacting with her and seeing how she interacts with others, I think that she has a lot of potential to be a great leader, someone that her peers will admire and look up to.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Ji Eun would work well with upperclass students, although I wouldn't hesitate to say that she has potential to be a great PL as well. She tends to be more hands-off in her personal relationships, but is always there for her friends when they need her which I think would be a personality quality that would click well with the RA position.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes! Ji Eun is responsible, motivated, and hard-working, which are all great qualities in any person that you would want to have on a SSM staff team. I've seen a lot of potential in her for the past two years and I think that becoming an SSM will be a good challenge and growing experience for her.
