In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Noah is from my hometown and is a former student of my mother's.  I assisted with in Science Olympiad and Science Fair competitions which he was involved in and encouraged his application to GT.  I have known Noah for two years.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Noah served in leadership positions in high school which required him to plan events and work out conflicts among other members.  Noah creates camaraderie on a team which will translate to building community on a residential floor.  He has adapted well to life at GT and learned the resources available to him, and I am confident he will be able to guide his residents with that transition as well.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As an SSM, Noah would have opportunities to grow his leadership and organizational skills as he serves his residents throughout the year.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Noah would be most successful with first-year students since he will be able to identify with and guide them through the experiences of freshman year.  Noah works best with those who are friendly, outgoing, and who value their studies.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I think Noah would make a great SSM.  Noah is a good student and a strong leader and will be a great role model to his residents while fostering a supportive community on his floor.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
As a former GT Peer Leader, I think Noah would make both a great Peer Leader and a great co-PL to work with - he is always willing to help others and has a great sense of teamwork.  Noah will make a great addition to the GT Housing Staff.
