Friend

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant for 1.5 years. I have observed him in an academic and extracurricular setting.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Kaie is a person who never lets things bring him down. He will always work at things until he succeeds and is not afraid to ask for help if needed. He is also very easy to talk to and is someone that people feel very comfortable seeking guidance from. Kaie also knows how to set priorities and stick to them. This shows his dedication and responsibility. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
One thing Kaie can improve on is getting more involved in extracurriculars on campus. He is  has been in marching band, concert band, and working at the cheesecake factory. However, this allows more time for him to spend on this SSM position.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe Kaie would be most successful with upperclassmen students. He works well with people who need help but would do better with people who are already on a path or know a little bit about what they are doing. For example, he would be able to help people by directing them to resources that would help them excel in their majors, but may not be as good in helping people decide a major from the start. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do believe that this candidate would make a good SSM because of his characteristics and diligence. He will work hard at this position until he can become the best in the position.  

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I believe he would be a great match for the SSM position and would do everything in his power to be extraordinary at it.
