For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
I am the DP Coordinator from Ogun's high school

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have personally known Ogun during the last four years of his educational life from his former high school, Ozel Bilkent Lisesi. I am the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (IB DP) Coordinator within the school and was also his Information Technology in a Global Society (ITGS) teacher. I was formerly his Creativity-Action-Service (CAS) Advisor in his Junior year and from 2011 -2015 I was also his Model United Nations (MUN) Coordinator for co-curricular activities.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I had the pleasure of teaching Ogun in my ITGS class and, despite this subject being distinctly complex, he was able to offer excellent opinions based on sound evidence and logical conclusion.   As his CAS Advisor, I saw that Ogun really demonstrated a caring and friendly persona by participating in a community service conducting learning activities for young children of ill health at a local school for the mentally disabled. This provided a great service to the centre whose staff was extremely appreciative of all his kind efforts. Ogun and his colleagues conducted themselves in such a professional manner that this has become a huge success and is now an annual activity for other students studying the IB programme.  Ogun was elected as Vice President within our schools' MUN club. His guidance was evident as he continued to offer advice and encouragement to other delegates within the club during hectic and stressful times, yet always maintained a confident and professional demeanour.   Ogun had a near perfect attendance at school which reflected his awareness of academic responsibility. Ogunâ€™s devotion to his studies was characteristic of the conscientiousness that he displayed toward his educational life.   He is extremely motivated to learn, yet open to criticism; building on his strengths while learning from past experiences. He was always well respected by his colleagues and peers.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
At times Ogun can possibly be over entusiastic and wants to try and achieve more than is capable. He takes time to listen to colleagues and peers in order to discuss the best approach, however.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I beleive Ogun would work very well with all students since he has the maturity of someone much older. Ogun has travelled to various different countries and experienced many cultures. He is open minded and knowledgeable of international customs.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I truly believe Ogun would make a good SSM for all the previous reasons offered. He is a hard worker and often takes the role of leadership due to his positive persona and ability to work well with everyone, even under pressure.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
He recently came to visit me a couple of times whilst back in Ankara, Turkey over the winter break. It is always a pleasure to see him and I'm glad to hear that he is looking to take on responsibilities within the university.
