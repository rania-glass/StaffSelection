In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Maddie since August 2015 through a student organization.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Maddie is caring, kind, and makes everyone around her feel special and welcome. She is a very upbeat person, and would bring a positive energy and atmosphere to the residence hall. Maddie is also organized and a great communicator. She is one of a very few number of freshmen to hold an officer position in our sorority, and is a natural leader whom people look up to and respect.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I can see Maddie further developing her personal leadership style and learning how to implement her strategies best in leadership situations.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Maddie would be most successful with first year students. She excels in person-to-person interactions, and is very talented at making even short conversations feel meaningful. I feel that Maddie would be successful with many personality types. She would be able to match the energy of the residents who are more outgoing, but also is very aware of her surroundings and can quiet herself and engage with more reserved students.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Maddie would make a great SSM. She is patient with others and actively cares about the people around her. She is very engaging, and is great at striking up conversations and making them feel meaningful. Maddie is also organized, creative, and great communicator, so I think she would excel on the more administrative side of the SSM role as well.
