N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've known Tyler for one semester (we met in Fall 2015). He has been a teaching assistant for a class that I also TA for.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Tyler is very reliable and diligent. He was extremely dependable as a TA and was always willing to volunteer above and beyond his responsibilities (for instance, in writing extra homework problems, or grading more than required).

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Tyler is somewhat reserved; he has an unassuming sense of humor and doesn't always go out of his way to engage others; I think that the position would help him become more outgoing.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Tyler worked really well with the other new TAs on the team especially; in small group situations he was able to coordinate teaching and grading and wrote great homework problems. As a fairly extroverted person, I think that Tyler and I coalesced well; he is more cautious and quiet, whereas I'm more boisterous, and it made a good combination. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. He stood above the rest of the TAs with his level of responsibility and dedication to hard work, which are crucial qualities for a SSM.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
My only concerns are that he definitely isn't the most outgoing applicant--but I wasn't either when I first got the TA job, and I learned quickly. I think these are skills he could easily pick up.
