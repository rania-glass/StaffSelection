In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I met Manali in Fall 2014 and have been in constant regular contact ever since.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I know Manali to be a particularly passionate person when it comes to the things she is involved in. Take for example her efforts to gain experience in the medical field. She puts in a lot of work to get involved both in and around campus and most if not all these endeavors help to supplement her goal to go to medical school.  Its obvious that Manali can strongly get behind what ever it is she puts her mind to.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Manali is has an incredibly nice personality which she carries with her where ever she goes. This is great but could be something she might need to hold back on when it comes time, in the SSM position, to be more confrontational with residents. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I feel like Manali would be a great asset as a PL rather than an RA. She has a lot of experience mentoring others (a huge part of the PL job) and she is the kind of person who can easily make meaningful relationships with her residents. Her particular academic and extra-curricular experience would also make her well suited to work in a pre-health living learning community.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
If I didn't think she would be a good SSM I wouldn't be writing this recommendation for her. Manali would be an excellent addition to the SSM community and I highly recommend her.
