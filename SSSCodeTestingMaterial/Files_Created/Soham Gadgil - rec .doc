What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Soham’s strengths tailored to the SSM position are his ability to adapt to situations, his time management, and his personability. As an international student, he has seamlessly adapted to American culture and is heavily involved in Georgia Tech’s culture. He makes an effort to understand how different cultures value things, and has assimilated many of the things that are difficult for others to do so, such as American humor, pastimes, etc. As his resume suggests, Soham is incredibly intelligent and is stellar in academic settings, largely in part to his incredible time management skills. On our floor, Soham is often, if not always the first person to finish assignments, usually within the first few days of their assigning. Furthermore, he actively seeks opportunities to get involved in, and has lots of experience looking for positions in organizations, and is involved around many communities on campus, such as SAA and India club. Soham also has a great balance of extroverted and introverted qualities, which allows him to connect with people of various dispositions, which I have observed firsthand in his interactions with his floormates. People enjoy being around Soham, and he enjoys group settings. He works very well individually and in group settings, as he has a good balance of contributing to discussions and listening and improving on others. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Soham possesses a skillset that is well tailored to serving as an SSM, and working in this role will allow him to develop his communication, organization, and interaction skills. He has extensive experience in leadership roles already, and his involvement in activities such as RoboJackets and IEEE provide evidence of his ability to work in a team setting. Additionally, Soham serves on SAA’s marketing committee with me, and I am impressed by his contributions to our brainstorming sessions, his ability to organize events, and his enthusiasm when volunteering for tasks. Conversing with Soham is always a pleasure, as he is witty and inquisitive, always seeking to know more. With the training in active listening and reflective questioning, I feel that Soham would become a standout communicator, especially with his background in different cultures. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
The candidate would be successful with both first- years and upperclass residents due to the strengths discussed above. I believe that Soham would work best with first years, as his experiences in adapting to both a new country and university life would be invaluable for first year freshman experience residents.  His involvement on campus and academic excellence would give his residents a valuable resource in getting started on the right track at Georgia Tech. Furthermore, his enthusiasm and willingness to learn about culture and traditions will provide him and his residents ample opportunity for various events and escapades.  Soham would work best with other international students, particularly those from India, as he has served in that mentor role already. However, his cheerful demeanor and enthusiasm would allow him to get along with all personalities, and would make him an excellent SSM.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Soham will be a very successful SSM as he has the qualities necessary for it, along with being involved on campus while being excellent in the classroom. His academic excellence would encourage his residents to model themselves after him, and his involvement would encourage his residents to do so as well. His personality would allow for quick bonding which would lead to a strong community. His enthusiasm translates to him always being up for events or floor bonding activities, evidenced by our all too frequent midnight snack runs. In staff, he would provide a valuable perspective being from a different culture, which allows him to tailor events and advertising in such a way that people from different backgrounds would understand and would be made to feel welcome.
