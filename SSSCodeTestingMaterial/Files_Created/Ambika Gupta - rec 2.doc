In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Ambika is my resident this year, and I have known her for one semester.  

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ambika is extremely friendly and approachable. Many of the girls are drawn to her because of her genuineness, humor, and honesty. She is always around the hall, checking on others on the floor, and even checking on me. She feels comfortable talking to men and women. Her leadership capabilities and organization skills are even obvious outside of the residence hall: she pledged to a service sorority this semester and was chosen to be the leader of her pledge class. She can also be incredibly mature when faced with a serious situation. When another girl on the floor was throwing up in the bathroom and I asked her to help me clear out the space, she respectfully asked the other girls to leave the bathroom so that I could help out the sick resident and the situation would be calmer. I believe her ability to manage stressful situations like this could translate well to emergency duty calls. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I anticipate Ambika's biggest issues being with practicing authoritativeness (because she connects with people on a personal level very quickly) and time management. Having said that, she does not procrastinate to the extent that it distracts others. She is aware of social cues and leaves people alone (including me) when asked. She also ended up getting good grades on all of her exams!  

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
While Ambika connects well with anyone, she has the most fun with others close to her age. Considering how well she has bonded with first-year students and all of the PLs in our building, I think working with first-years would be best for her. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Ambika would make a great SSM and could gain a lot from the position by getting hired now. She takes criticism well and truly cares about others. She would also improve her time management skills and ability to practice authority if she were hired as an SSM next semester, rather than the year after.
