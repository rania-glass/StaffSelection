In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant for 6 months, as a fellow member of the same fraternity

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Eric's strengths as a potential SSM are his friendly disposition and enthusiasm, his event programming skills and experience, and his work ethic. Eric is a very friendly and amiable individual, and is great at making others comfortable with him and is a clear communicator, helping him connect with residents and serving as a source of support for his residents and fellow staff members. I've also worked with him in planning social events for different sized groups, and he has the organizational skills necessary to plan and execute hall events and building wide events along with other staff. Eric also has an inspiring work ethic, willing to knock out any tasks put in front of him, and consistently meeting the deadlines and requirements set. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Eric's only area of development is his struggles of procrastination. He tends to push back work until it piles up, and although he always gets his work done, it can lead to stressful periods for him when assignments pile up.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Eric would be most successful with first-year students. His professional and academic experience along with his willingness to assist anyone who needs help would aid him in being a great mentor and support source for younger students. Although I feel he would also do well in the RA role with upperclass students, I believe his openness and ability to engage and connect with people would be best served in the development of first year communities in the Freshman Experience.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that Eric would make an excellent SSM. He excels in the interpersonal skills necessary to connect with residents and foster an open community and has a great attitude, which I believe would help him mesh well with his fellow staff members.
