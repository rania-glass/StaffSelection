In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I was Kaleigh's PL in Matheson her freshman year; I have become good friends with Kaleigh and still keep in contact with her.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Kaleigh is always full of energy and ready to make a new friend. She is both a reliable listener  in times of counsel and an enthusiastic motivator for times of action. She interacts well with all people; students, adults, proffessors, etc.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Kaleigh is a very outgoing and friendly indivudial, but as a SSM this energy she has must be both controlled and maintained. I would like to see her learn to use the leadership, social, and counseling skills she already has in a way that conserves her energy and serves people in her community who need it. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I see Kaleigh working best with first-years where she can put her high energy to good use, but she would work well with all types of students because she is very mature and competent. Kaleigh works best with personalities who are laid-back, positive, or willing to interact. She works least well with personalities who are closed off and correcting. Kaliegh is flexible and adaptable with almost all people and all situations.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Kaleigh would make an incredible SSM! Her energy and laid-back personality is perfect for a residence hall at Tech where so many students need a listening ear and a friendly face. She manages her time well and would be able to handle all responsibilities of the job.
