I taught undergraduate students as a PhD candidate and Rachel was my student.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Rachel was in my MGT 3000 (Introduction to Financial and Managerial Accounting ) class  last fall semester. I have known her for about half a year. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
From my interaction with Rachel in the class, I find her to be very hardworking and dedicated. Accounting can be difficult for many non-business majors, but Rachel's persistence helps her to become one of the top performers throughout the semester. I believe that her good work ethics will make her a reliable SSM.   Rachel is very enthusiastic about learning and always asks good questions to contribute to the class.  I often give students some time to work on class exercises together, and I always observe her helping others to learn. I think her willingness and ability to help peer students will make her a good SSM. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
After reading the job description of SSMs, I do feel that Rachel has all the qualities it takes to become a good SSM. As her accounting instructor, I do not know how knowledgeable she is about the resources and services offered by the college right now. But I do believe that as a fast learner, she can quickly acquire the knowledge and skill it takes to be a good resource to her peer students. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Rachel would be most successful with first-years because herself is a first-year now. I think she will understand and help the challenging transition many first-years face.  In terms of personalities, I think Rachel will work well with both extroverts and introverts.  I find Rachel to be friendly and easygoing, and I observe her getting along with both the most outspoken student in my class and students who are a bit shy.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I strongly believe that Rachel will be a good SSM. As I mentioned before, she is hardworking, persistent, enthusiastic, and willing to help others. I believe these qualities will make her a responsible and reliable SSM.
