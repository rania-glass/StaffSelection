N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known  the applicant for over four months (1 semester). I have interacted with him at least three times weekly during the Fall 2015 semester. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Sociability: Ian is not afraid to walk up to someone and start a conversation. He does this regularly with the residents on our floor and is one of the few residents on the floor who has gone to other floors to meet new people. Cultural interest: Although he may not be familiar with many different cultures and backgrounds, he likes learning about them. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Ian has never had to plan and organize a residential program before. He has come to floor programs often but hasn't seen the behind-the-scenes work that goes into it. If chosen to be an SSM, this would be a critical area of development for Ian. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This candidate will be most successful with first years. Because Ian is so social and is a good conversationalist, he would excel in an environment of people willing to meet new people as well. Upperclassmen aren't as willing as first years to leave their rooms and meet new people, so an RA position may not work as well for Ian. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Ian will make a great SSM. He works well with people on the floor and can adapt to different personality types in conversation and interaction, without generating conflict. When on the intramural teams, Ian has been a decent team player, trying to help the team move forward rather than himself.
