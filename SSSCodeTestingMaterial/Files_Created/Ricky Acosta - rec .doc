He represented MYLA as the Youth Liaison where he worked to educate and energize the community (youth and adults) around issues related to youth. Rickyâ€™s exceptional contributions to MYLA have been through his technology skills. He developed, created, and produced several videos for MYLAâ€™s events. The videos are educational and train youth in Virginia Beach and the Hampton Roads Region on prevention efforts of alcohol, drugs, bullying, peer pressure, and positive decision-making.
