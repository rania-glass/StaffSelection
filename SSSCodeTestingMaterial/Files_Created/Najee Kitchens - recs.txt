In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Najee for almost 2 years.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Her greatest strength would be her ability to do everything that she is asked to do with great quality and a positive attitude. Her method for completing tasks assigned to her is always the most effective and easy to understand. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As a potential SSM, I could see her needing to develop her communication skills a bit more. She is, by no means, a bad communicator, shes just hesitant to take the first step to make those necessary connections and continue with the maintenance of friendships relationships. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
She would be most successful with upper class students. This is mainly because the personality type that she will succeed with is the more independent, experienced, type. Freshmen need a bit more nurturing, and guidance, but Najee is fantastic at providing an outline for success and the necessary info to benefit from it. Upper class students would be the idea audience for her type of leadership, and seeing that she is also an upper class student herself, her time commitments would mix well with those of an RA than a PL.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that given the opportunity, Najee would rise up to the position. Having had experience with working on various teams with her, as well as interacting with her in more casual situations, I have full faith in her ability to be a good example for residents while simultaneously completing the necessary requirements in the SSM position.   

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I would like to include that she is currently volunteering as an RHA Finance Coordinator for Zbar and Maulding. This involves team work and coordination with the Events Coordinator and Meetings Coordinator. There are very few upperclassment who seek SSM positions who are previously involved with housing, and Najee does. She has seen glimpses of how it works and it would only serve as a benefit if she were to be given a position.
