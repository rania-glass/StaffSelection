In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant since he has been at Georgia Tech, and I am in contact with him almost every day.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Shane comes from a very diverse background and understands how to work well with many different types of people. Also, Shane is extremely outgoing, positive, and passionate about this position. From my time being a PL, I have realized that the most passionate SSMs tend to be the best ones.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?

Shane would very well with residents who are also outgoing and excited to explore tech and see what's in store for them in Atlanta. He also has a great approach on the more introverted people and he can usually initiate great conversations with anyone. He has expressed his interest in working with first years because he would feel so close to them and be able to guide them. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Shane would be one of the best SSMs because he has already done this job previously in boarding school along with the fact that he is extremely passionate and diligent in his duties. I would love for Shane to work on my staff.
