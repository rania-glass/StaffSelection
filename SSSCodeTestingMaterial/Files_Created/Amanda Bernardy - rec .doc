Her Academic College Advisor

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known her for three years as her College Counselor. I was responsible for academic, socio-emotional and general counseling. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Amanda possesses a strong sense of self.  I believe this quality is a wonderful addition to supervisory position because she will allow her inner compass to direct .guide her vs. peer influence.  Within our community, she was a very honest - a straight shooter.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Amanda was always very busy.  She managed to juggle athletics, vocal choir duties, and a heavy academic load.  I often found her stretched. No complaints - because she always managed to get it all done at a high level, but I did worry about her staying sane.  She has matured and I know she can do this - my one caution is for her to balance it all in a healthy way.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I am not sure that I find her limited in any way.  I am tempted to say First Year students because she has been a lovely mentor to younger girls here in our community, though I think she'd be fine with her own peers, too.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. A strong moral compass and a friendly disposition will leave her well equipped for this role.  I have worked on a college campus and believe her to be the type of student that is chosen to lead in the dorms.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Amanda is a great kid - she works hard and stands by her ideals.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
