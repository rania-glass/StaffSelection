N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Bintou was in my ENGL 1102 class in Fall 2015. The course was a 25-person seminar. Bintou also met with me outside of class in office hours. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Bintou is conscientious about managing her time and fulfilling classroom responsibilities. She is a creative problem solver and, in particular, she is engaged with sociopolitical issues. She founded and led a feminist organization at her high school and was consistently sensitive to issues of race, gender, and class in my course--more so than nearly all of my other students. She wrote about the concept of diaspora and the experiences of first-generation students in one of her assignments. Her awareness of the diverse life experiences of Georgia Tech students make her an ideal SSM, one that would be a sensitive and thoughtful resource for a wide range of students. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Bintou was a quiet but thoughtful presence in my classroom. In small groups and in office hours, she always contributed thoughtfully to intellectual and practical problem-solving. She can be a bit reserved initially, but she quickly opens up and demonstrates a thoughtful, engaged, positive personality. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Bintou would work very well with first-year students, but she also seems more mature than most other first-years. Although she can get along well with very outgoing students, Bintou would work well with quiet and shy students. She has a calm presence that makes her approachable but not intimidating. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Bintou would make a good SSM because she is responsible, open, positive, and thoughtful. She consistently produced polished, thorough work in my course and has extensive work experience in customer service positions. This work experience demonstrates that she can get along with all kinds of people and can problem-solve creatively. She demonstrated her inter-personal and problem-solving skills in my course, where she was required to collaborate on a large-scale research project with four other students. She took on much of the creative work of making an infographic and helped the group revise the project in response to peer critique.
