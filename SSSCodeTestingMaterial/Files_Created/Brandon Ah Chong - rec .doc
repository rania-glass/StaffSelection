In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
5 Years

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Brandon is very diligent and reliable. He is always on time and is someone who you can count on to get their job done right. He will put 100% into his work if he becomes a SSM

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Brandon does very well academically but isn't very familiar with Campus Greek life (something that can be developed). In my opinion, he would work as a good co-PL to a greek guy as he could better relate to the non greek residents.

I believe he works better with first years, he has as little brother that he actively watches over and mentors. I can see him doing the same with his residents.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, he has demonstrated the ability help his brother grow and mingle well with his friends at Tech. I believe these skills will transfer over to be a PL. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
He is a great that would make a great PL
