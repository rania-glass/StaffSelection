Youth Minister during High School

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have had the privilege of knowing Ms. Tan for 3 years and her family since 2006.  I am the Youth Ministry Coordinator at St. Mary's Catholic Church and Ms. Tan is one of my prior High School Youth Leaders.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ms. Tan is very solution -focused as well as flexible and empathetic.  She attended a week long Youth Leadership training session with our Parish in July of 2014 where she interacted with 75 other Youth Leaders and learned key leadership skills (i.e. communication, problem solving, etc.) While attending the session, she emerged to be a leader among the attendees.  She learned several ice breaker activities, how to work in a team environment, and most importantly how to utilize the gifts and skills of all participants in a group situation to yield positive results.  She is truly a natural leader in that she collaborates to achieve results.  Her Fillipino heritage coupled with her American upbringing make her very approachable to a wide variety of needs.  In July of 2015 she attended a  beach retreat in Florida with 140 youth.  Her small group consisted of 12 teens and the small groups had a dance contest with one another.  She emerged as a leader of her small group and helped choreograph the contest's winning dance routine.  Her natural ability to blend fun while paying attention to detail make her a natural at planning and executing social events.  But perhaps her most compelling  strength is her desire to serve others.  It is this gift that would make her a highly resourceful SSM.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Perhaps an area for development would be additional experience in the SSM role and of course training for the role.  Given her service heart and her adaptable nature, she would rise to the need.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Perhaps upperclass students would appeal to Ms. Tan's mature nature rather than the first-years.   That said, she is quite empathetic and would find whatever resources necessary to assist with the situation at hand  (i.e. manage homesickness, assist with making decisions about classes, etc.)

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely.  Ms. Tan is diplomatic, dependable, trustworthy, and has a high level of accountability for results.  She will take her duties and responsibilities seriously without seeming to be overbearing.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
My experiences with Ms. Tan have been unique in that most of the time spent with her has been in large group settings where she is required to interact with many peers; not unlike the role she would play as an SSM.  I have witnessed her positively interact and handle diverse situations that at times can be highly emotional due to the nature of the event.  She remains calm, stays focused, solves problems and is diplomatic.  In my role as Youth Coordinator, she has been a source of leadership strength among our Parish (1200 families).  If you select her, she will not disappoint.....
