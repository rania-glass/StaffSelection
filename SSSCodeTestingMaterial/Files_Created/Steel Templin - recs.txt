In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
He has been my resident since August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Steel is very socially active on the hall. I think he feels comfortable in almost every situation, which allows him to bridge relationships together. Therefore his biggest strength is bringing people together in a comfortable social gathering.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Unfortunately his comfort in most situations often leads to either offense or insult due to a slight lack of a verbal filter. This combined with a lack of sensitivity makes for a pretty awkward encounter when someone is easily offended. This isn't always a problem, in fact its a fairly rare occurrence, but either way it's definitely an area for improvement. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Only freshman. He works well with people that are both very outgoing and extremely social. I don't see him having much success with introverts, but in the few encounters I have witnessed between Steel and introverts they haven't been terrible.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
No, not yet. His maturity level is very low for a leadership position. It's important for him to understand that joking is fun and typically a good idea, but the fact that he is both insensitive and not very mature would make SSM a very difficult position for him to be successful in.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
He's involved in NROTC, which is a very good program and I felt like it is worth mentioning.
