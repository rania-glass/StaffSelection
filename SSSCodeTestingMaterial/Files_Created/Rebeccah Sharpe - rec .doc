In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have worked with Becca for about 5 years as her manager.

Becca is able to work with all types of personalities and still keep the front of the store running smoothly.  She has the ability to make everyone feel welcome from the customers to new wait staff. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
She can communicate very easily with everyone and her time management ability seems effortless.  She has trained many associates and given them the tools to be successful.  Becca is easy going, trustworthy and responsible. This is someone you can depend on.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe upperclass students would be a perfect fit.  She understands the shy type and can keep drama at bay for those who are more outgoing.  She can rally the troops so to say for any new project. Her dependability keeps everyone at ease.

Yes she would be a great SSM.  She is someone you can count on, has a fun loving personality, is intelligent and well rounded.  This opportunity for her will just build on her strengths.
