N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Eric was my resident last year. He is part of the Honors Program and I was in my 2nd year as an Honors Program PL. This year, Eric is part of SAA leadership as well so I have seen him grow a lot from last year. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Eric thinks before he acts. In all honesty, that was not the case with the other residents last year and that is what really shone for me with him as a resident. He articulates a lot more than people his age and definitely brings maturity into any position he is in. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
He can be quiet sometimes and takes some time to open up to people. I think that you need all types of SSMs and this quality is sometimes needed as well when it comes to a dynamic group. He can definitely work on his shyness if given the chance. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I personally think he would work great with freshman. He definitely has the potential to work with upper-class men but at this stage he would work a lot better with freshman residents. He has a pretty calm personality and I think that is where he is most comfortable as well. I personally do not think he has had too much conflict resolution training and or experience so that is an area he may not work well with in the beginning until he gets some training. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Definitely, although every candidate has potential to grow, Eric has already shown great depth and growth since last year even from me being his PL to now being on SAA leadership with him. If that much can change in one year, I think he would be able to grow exponentially through being a SSM. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I think Eric would be a great addition to any staff, especially since he had and still has great camaraderie with his freshman hall mates and that is something he could definitely bring into the position if he has the chance to showcase it by being a SSM.
