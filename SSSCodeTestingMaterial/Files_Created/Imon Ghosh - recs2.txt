In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Imon was a student in my Math 1502 course in Fall 2015, and I was his instructor. I have known Imon for roughly 4 months.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Although I did not get to know Imon very well last semester, Imon attended my 8:30 am Math 1502 lectures regularly and completed all required course work. His regular attendance and hard work would be assets in this position.
