In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I was Sydney White's direct supervisor for four weeks during the summer of 2015.  I had a very good chance to know Sydney and her work ethic during that summer.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
In the short time that I have known Sydney White I would highly recommend her for the Peer Leader position.  In the 5 years that I have directed the GoSciTech summer science program, Sydney is easily in the top 1% of the students who worked for me.  Sydney is a fanatic leader with both students, colleagues, and parents.  For the Student Assistant (SA) position that Sydney held, she had to do many of the tasked listed in the above statement; organize social events, mediate conflicts between campers, help campers during class along with teach even science activities.  I can't say in strong enough words how well Sydney did and well she would do at GT.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Sydney's only downfall was how dedicated she was to making sure that the summer camp went well for every.  Many times some of her peer works started to back out of their responsibilities and Sydney always picked up the slack.  Because of this she started to get overworked by the end of the summer.  She needed to be able to say no to her peers that took advantage of her hard work and dedication.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Sydney would work well with any resident.  She worked well at our camp with both middle high school students, her SA peers (same age), along with all of the supervisors at the camp.    The GoSciTech program had a variety of personal with many different personalities.  I think Sydney would do an excellent job working with anyone. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Sydney would make a fantastic Peer Leader.  In the summer of 2015 her dedicated work as an SA for the GoSciTech was unequal to any other SA I had.  She worked well with others, she was one of the best and most reliable SAs that I have worked with.  Sydney has a kind and caring nature.  She likes to take care of people and truly respects everyone.  

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I wholehearedly endorse Sydney White's application for a Peer Leader at GT.  She was an excellent employee for me and I am sure that she would be the same at GT. Please feel free to contact me for more details or any other question you may have.  I would enthusiastically rehire Sydney to work for me again!  One last think.  During the last days of the GoSciTech camp.  Another SA asked Sydney to switch shifts with her, of which Sydney agreed.   During that shift we had a situation arise where Sydney ended up talking to a very very irate mother.  Sydney should not have had to talk to this mother (that was another staff members responsibtily), but she handled herself with great maturity and I was very proud of her for that.
