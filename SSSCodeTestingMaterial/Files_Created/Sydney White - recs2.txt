In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have gotten to know Sydney very well this past semester because she was my resident. She made a lot of effort to create a community for herself but most importantly for others in which everyone sorority and non-sorority girls could hang out and get to know each other. As I started doing midweek munchies, Sydney made sure to help each week. If there was a week where she had a lot of homework, she would bring her work to the kitchen so that she could give me company. I think she has done a phenomenal job leaving her door open and branching out to the girls to create a living learning space as a resident.
