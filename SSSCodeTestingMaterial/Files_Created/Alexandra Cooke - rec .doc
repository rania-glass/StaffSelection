In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have gotten to know Alexandra over the past semester, seeing her three times a week for class.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
She is very kindhearted. She is very approachable and would be open and helpful to any and all kinds of resident. She is disciplined and would be a reliable for enforcing rules AND following them. She has an honest passion to be an SSM.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
She is quiet-natured at first impression. She is not an extremely goofy or loud person, but more reserved. It may be a growing experience for her to have to speak up as a leader, but I think she is absolutely up for it. She told me that last year, her RA was so wonderful and had so many social events (she lived in Woodies, but still knew almost everyone on the whole hall well, and where they lived)! She does have that motivation and desire for community and wants to help create it!

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Alexandra told me that she would love to be an RA in Woodruff. She loves that they have to only share a bathroom with 1-3 people, but also likes that students are not in apartments.  She realizes that apartment floors are much less social, and wants to really have community. If she cannot mention her preference for Woodies, she would still like to be an RA. She wants to work with upperclassmen. I think this would be a very good fit for her. Because she is not the 'loud assertive person' in a social group, it would be better for her to not have freshmen who need more guidance, discipline, etc. But I believe in her capability to move outside what is comfortable for disciplining when necessary.   Personalities...she would work well with nearly anyone honestly..she is really open and kind. I guess she would work least well with aggressive and unkind people.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
 I really do. She really holds a very high regard for the position of a SSM - she has seen the impact an RA can have on students' experience here, and really wants to make a difference. She had an amazing RA last year (Kelsey), and this year, her experience really hasn't been so positive. She really has a heart for having a community within the residence hall - which is really optimistic, and I think she has seen both really good, and not so good SSMs, so it is significant that she still has this hope and goal. Alexandra is very approachable and kind. She would be an asset to any staff.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Alexandra is a really wonderful person. I think this would be such a good opportunity for her...she would appreciate it so much - which would make her so much better at the job than a good portion of the other applicants. I know that she would be very excited to be able to grow through the opportunity. She loves community, and I honestly believe she has the heart (and most importantly the TIME to do so!!) She is not extremely busy, so she would be very present for her residents.
