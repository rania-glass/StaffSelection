For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Served as Vice President of our fraternity when Zwolinski was house manager

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've known Mr. Zwolinski for 8 years dating back to our time as undergrads at Auburn Univeristy. We both held leadership positions in our fraternity. Matt was the best house manager we ever had. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I've seen Mr. Zwolinski in this sort of position already first hand. His duties as a house manager required him to schedule cleaning duties, mediate problems between work crews and ensure house rules were followed. In a house of 20-22 18 year old boys, this is no small task. He handled the responsibilities with great care and took his job seriously. He was the enforcer of house rules but also knew how to be diplomatic. I know with his background as house manager he is up to this task. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Mr. Zwolinski's passion and care for his job can sometimes be mistaken as him taking the job too seriously. But his personality and charisma should be able to show the residents that it isn't anything personal. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think with Mr. Zwolinski's background he should be able to deal with any manner of students thrown his way. During his time as house manager, he was responsible for dealing with students of all ages, from freshmen just entering college, to 5th year seniors who may have thought they were too cool to follow the rules. Mr. Zwolinski isn't able to handle each person on an individual basis and not just group everybody together and treat them the same. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe he would make a great SSM. He's fun, outgoing but at the same time knows when it's time to get serious. I believe any RA has to know how to toe this line to maintain the respect of the residents he is in charge of. As house manager he always had a knack for knowing when he needed to crack down but also when he could back off and let the groups do what they needed to do to get the chores done. I believe he can bring those same qualities to this position. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Just to sum up my thoughts, I believe Mr. Zwolinski is wise beyond his years. And he could be a valuable person residents could come and talk to besides just residential issues. He's been through a lot and may be able to help give younger students guidance on problems they may be having.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
I always said in school that if we all had the work ethic of Matthew Zwolinski, we could rule the world. You will never meet a person who works harder at anything he puts his mind to. He will be a valuable asset to your group.
