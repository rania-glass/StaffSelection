In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
The Ohio Association of Student Councils provides leadership training to students throughout Ohio. As director, I select, train, and supervise our staff members who facilitate the training. I first met Mihir when he attended our programs as a junior high school student. I was then thrilled to accept his application to serve on our staff throughout his high school years. It has been my privilege to know and work with him for 7 years. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Mihir is both outgoing and quite approachable. He connects easily with his peers. He is a very rational thinker and is able to find effective, creative solutions to challenges or conflicts that may arise. Mihir is extremely reliable, always following through with his commitments, and doing so competently; he holds himself to very high standards. He is a wonderful role model for others to follow. Most importantly, Mihir is compassionate toward others and is driven by his passion make a positive impact. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
In my experiences working with Mihir, the area that sometimes required attention was personal stress management. As a very high achiever with lots of interests and involvements, he can become very stressed. He has made major improvements with this as he has matured. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Mihir would be wonderful working with mostly first-years at this time, He loves to share his knowledge and experience and help to guide others toward their own successes. He works very well with others - regardless of differences in personalities. He seeks to find commonalities and builds from there. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe wholeheartedly that Mihir would be an excellent SSM. As I read the 'job description' at the start of this recommendation, I was able to say that he meets (and exceeds) every requirement and expectation. I am 100% confident that he would very positively impact all with whom he works, both SSM peers and residents alike. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I honestly can't say enough good things about Mihir. He is an exceptional young man. Please feel free to contact me if you should require any further information. connie.miley@oasc-oh.org or (937) 751-8530.
