N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been Sheng's PL for the past semester.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Sheng takes a keen part in all the floor activities and shows initiative, if given a responsibility. He is also very punctual with any on floor duties that I delegate to him.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Sheng has struck me as being very reticent and introverted. This is, along with his soft skills, are something he should work on.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Since Sheng is naturally a very introverted person, he might not be able to deal with and professionaly interact with people senior to him, i.e upperclassmen. This is why I think he will be a better PL than an RA.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
As far as duties and responsibilities are concerned, I am confident that Sheng will carry them out with utmost diligence. But I have my doubts when it comes to him establishing a personal connection with his residents, given his introverted nature.
