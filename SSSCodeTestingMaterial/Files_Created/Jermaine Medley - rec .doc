In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Jermaine since the summer of 2014 when he came to speak to me about the Denning Technology & Management (T&M) Program at the Scheller College of Business. It became very clear after our discussion, that the T&M Program needed Jermaine more than he probably needed us. He was already a poised go getter that could successfully network to land high-level internships. (Our program strives to train students to be innovative multidisciplinary leaders and through the two years of academic and non-academic components, Denning scholars interact with our 12 corporate affiliates and their senior leadership.) But Jermaine's positive spirit and willingness to help everyone around him succeed is what makes him shine. It was this aura of embracing the world around him that solidified the Denning T&M Program's need for him to join the T&M Class of 2017. Since his acceptance to the Program, he has stood out as a leader uniting his peers to form a community of teamwork. I serve as the Communications Program Manager and in that capacity I serve as a writing and presentation coach for Jermaine. I have worked with him most extensively on his resume and next year I will partner with him on his presentation skills. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
When reading the above description of an SSM, I find myself nodding throughout the entire passage. Jermaine knows no stranger and constantly puts his more reserved classmates in the Denning T&M Program at ease by initiating conversations and using humor and his warm smile to draw them in. He has assisted in garnering support at our social events and brings enthusiasm with him wherever he goes. T&M is based on working on diverse teams across many aspects of diversity and Jermaine excels in this type of environment. He is also genuinely concerned with the welfare of others and offers solid advice to his peers. He would make an excellent liaison between the administration and the student body. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I have been at Georgia Tech for almost seven years now and am constantly learning about new resources and opportunities. One area where Jermaine can develop would be to schedule coffee meetings with different administrative leaders across campus to learn as much as possible about all of the services available to students. It would be a great exploratory opportunity to add to the information already accessible. He could also practice adjusting his vibrant energy to match different styles. I actually think he can already do this, but I could see where someone may be intimidated by his confidence and self-knowledge. He is very comfortable in his own shoes, which isn't always the case for everyone at Georgia Tech. There is no need for him to tone down his personality though.  

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I have witnessed Jermaine interactive very well with first-years, upperclass students, and international students. I think he is equally skilled in all areas and could be placed with whichever group had the greater need. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, Jermaine Medley would most definitely make a strong SSM. As mentioned earlier, the description of 'SSMs are among the most visible student leaders on campus, acting as counselors to all residents. Friendly and approachable, they are tasked with organizing formal and informal social events, mediating interpersonal conflicts and bringing general enthusiasm to the life in the residential communities' has his name written all over it and if you have had the pleasure of meeting him already, you would have to agree. Jermaine can't help but bring enthusiasm wherever he goes and he is able to move between diverse social groups with ease. He has a way about him that diffuses conflict and can garner support for social events. Because of his positive nature, residents would naturally follow his lead and seek him out for advice and counseling.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
I don't tend to select excellent for everything on these types of recommendations, but I wholeheartedly believe Jermaine Medley deserves an excellent rating. I selected good on creativity only because I haven't had the chance to witness him in that area yet. I assume I will see his creativity next year during his capstone project.
