Former Peer Leader

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant since August 2014 when she first started at Georgia Tech.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Manali is a very genuine person and she is easy to talk to. She always has a smile on her face. She made my job as a Peer Leader very easy because most of the time, she was making hall events and bringing residents together. She really liked to involve herself in housing events by going to all the hall council meetings, becoming a hall representative, getting to know her hall very well along with the residents in the neighboring halls and always having great ideas for our hall. She has assisted in a hall pot luck on Thanksgiving, fondue on Valentines day, weekly fitness events, along with other countless events. Overall, Manali is a great leader. She is super friendly and knows how to handle situations very well. She has a great personality that allows her to get along with anyone. She enjoys being busy and I know she would make the SSM position a top priority along with her academics. She is a very motivated and driven young lady and I am very pleased to recommend her for the position. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I remember when I first met Manali, she wanted to run for President of Hall Council. I helped her deliver cookies to residents door to door while she explained to them why she would make a great President for Hall Council. She started off her speech with little confidence and I can tell she was very nervous. She ended up not getting the position however she remained very active in hall council. However, after a full semester, she started passing bills and talking at hall council with a lot of confidence and poise. I noticed a major improvement after just a few months. Manali is a great leader, but I know she has the potential of being a much better leader. I know a SSM position will really help her grow as a person and help her be a better leader. She will be able to plan events on her own without having to consult with someone first. This job will really allow her to be more independent and will give her the confidence she needs to be an excellent leader. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Manali would be most successful with freshman. She has a lot to offer with her own personal experience as a freshman, choosing the right major, joining the right clubs, etc. I think Manali would work best with those who are younger than her because she is very helpful so I know her freshman residents would come to her for advice. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I believe Manali would make an excellent SSM. She has all the qualities of a great SSM as a Resident Assistant and as a Peer Leader. I believe a SSM should be easy to talk to and very open to any type of conversation. That's why I think Manali would make a great fit for this position, because I can see her talking to almost anyone. If there is a conflict, I know Manali would handle it and make both parties feel like they are being supported. Manali is very professional but she also handles everything with a smile, which would make her an excellent candidate. On top of being easy to talk to, she is organized, motivated, and always has great ideas. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Manali is involved in a lot on campus, so she would be a great resource for her residents. She is very knowledgeable about Tech Tradition, academic resources, clubs and organizations, and fun events.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Manali would make an excellent Peer Leader because she is a great listener and is always present. She is very approachable and is always willing to help others. Since a position of a SSM is also a lot of paper work, Manali is also very organized and completes assignments in a timely manner. I am honored to recommend Manali as a potential SSM.
