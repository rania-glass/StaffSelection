Please indicate what type of recommendation this is:
RA PL Recommendation (you have served as an RA or PL the 2016-2017 year)

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant for approximately 5 months as his PL.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Niall is often someone who fades into the background. Although his presence is known on the hall, it is often not known what he does specifically unless you ask. Then, you realize that Niall's strength is working quietly in the background to push initiatives forward, when they might otherwise fail. He is a quiet, but strong force.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Niall's strength also manifests itself as a weakness. Because he often goes unseen (metaphorically speaking), he is often unnoticed. Niall is definitely not the first person one would think of when they hear Howell 2, because his presence sometimes goes unnoticed. He is quiet, but I believe he will find his voice in time.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Niall would work best with upperclassmen. Although I believe he could succeed with freshmen, he lacks some of the drive needed to push freshmen.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I would say hire with reservations. I have no reason to believe that the candidate would not make a good SSM, but I have not seen any outstanding characteristics that would make me say 'definitely yes, hire this candidate'.
