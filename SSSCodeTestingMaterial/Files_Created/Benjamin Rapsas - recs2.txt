N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Ben has been a resident of mine since August. He's been an involved resident, attending events and even giving me suggestions for event plans. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ben is a very involved resident. He tries his best to make everyone feel like they are a part of a community. Ben is very involved on campus and can use his many involvements to benefit people. As a tour guide, he has been able to teach me things about Georgia Tech that I never knew and show me resources I did not know about. Ben is also very outspoken when he needs to be, a quality that will serve him well as an SSM. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Ben can be quiet. He uses this to demonstrate that he is thinking or trying to absorb what is happening. Ben is very involved on campus, which could possibly take away from his time as an SSM but I have not seen it as a problem thus far and don't think it will be an issue in the future. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Ben would work very well with first year students. His attitude about life is very good for first year students. He is very optimistic, even in the hard times. He was one to motivate me during a week of long exams, even though he had to worry about himself. He has been very good with students on the floor by trying to connect. Ben's shyness may come to be a bit of a hindrance with first year students but he should be able to work through that and use it to his advantage. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Ben would be an excellent student staff member. He has a knack for connecting with people and has a good grip on himself. He has never seemed overwhelmed or that he has too much on his plate, even though he is very involved in his community. Ben makes a good effort to reach out to everyone to make sure that they are doing well. Ben also has a talent for knowing exactly how to help someone in a situation, whether it is by pointing them to a resource he knows through his involvement on campus or by just listening, Ben makes everyone around him feel comfortable and ok with being themselves. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Ben would be a treat for any hall director to have. He is a great student, great person and overall a phenomenal asset. I would love to have Ben on my staff for the next year.
