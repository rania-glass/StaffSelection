In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have served as Rodrigo's Peer Leader for the duration of one semester, with intent to continue for the remainder of the year.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Rodrigo loves to spend time with other residents on his floor and throughout the residence hall.  He is more than friendly and approachable; he takes the time to listen to others, and is often extremely reflective and profound.  He also comes from a unique cultural background, which I believe would be an invaluable resource for many residents.  Outside of the residence hall, Rodrigo is active across campus in a variety of clubs and activities (i.e. GT Archery Club), which I see as an indication of his willingness to become involved in the community as a whole.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Despite being involved in myriad activities and clubs, I would describe Rodrigoâ€™s personality as initially reserved.  He is far less outgoing in his day to day countenance than the average SSM, which can be seen in several different lights.  This reserved nature could potentially be positive when establishing a connection with more introverted residents.  On the opposite side of that coin, this kind of personality may not click with other residents.  I believe that given the training and time to flourish as an SSM, especially with regard to developing strong relationships with residents, this concern would be minuscule if any longer relevant. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
As I mentioned before, I can see Rodrigo reaching out and connecting with those who might feel lonely or isolated as they enter the Housing experience.  Although I could see this working well for an RA who would be dealing with upperclassmen that might tend to keep to themselves, I believe that Rodrigo would be, as I said earlier, an invaluable resource to residents just entering Georgia Tech, coming from a wide variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds.  Even with the large differences between first-year and upperclass communities, I can honestly say that Rodrigoâ€™s overall persona would be a great fit for either community, with a slight lean towards the Freshman Experience.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
There is no doubt in my mind that Rodrigo would make an excellent SSM.  He is compassionate, understanding, and ready to help out at the drop of a hat.  Given his strong academic performance and involvement in extracurriculars, I believe that he would have no problem transitioning into the position.  Furthermore, were Rodrigo hired as an SSM, I am confident that he would provide a quality experience for residents of GT Housing.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
There are no significant concerns to note here, other than the fact that Rodrigo is an excellent candidate for an SSM position.
