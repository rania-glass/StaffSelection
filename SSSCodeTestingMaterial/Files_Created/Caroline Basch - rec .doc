Caroline is friendly, organized, motivated, hardworking.  She has an excellent positive attitude which is contagious.  It is always a pleasure to work with Caroline!

Although very competent, she can improve her leadership skills.  If she is tasked with being a leader she will fullfil the role without hesitation  and do an excellent job.
