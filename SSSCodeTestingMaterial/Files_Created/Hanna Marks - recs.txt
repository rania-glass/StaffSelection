Hannah is organized, friendly and highly engaged on campus (particularly in science).

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I am not sure.  I don't know of any weaknesses, but she may not have had training on dealing with students in crisis.  

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think she particularly wants to work with the freshman CoS-SMART living learning community.  She was part of this community as a freshman and is a mentor to this community this year through GT1000.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Hannah has been a leader in the CoS-SMART living learning community.  She organizes social activities and has mentored students in the community through GT1000.  She is caring and committed to the success of this program.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Hannah will provide a wealth of information to students in the CoS-SMART LLC, in addition to support with life skills (she is very mature and responsible), she could serve as academic support because she has succeeded in the very courses these students will be taking.
