ORGT staff

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Jake for approximately three years. We both volunteer our time for Outdoor Recreation Georgia Tech (ORGT). Jake leads caving trips.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Jake has utilized and learned many sets of skills as an ORGT staff member. Jake consistently mitigates risks and ensures staff and participant safety on trip. He takes his job seriously and strives to provide the best experience possible for the students. He works bery well with new and international students; he always places the customer&#039;s needs above his own and shapes the experience base on said need. He is a great listener and community builder. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Jake is a very thorough man. At times, he can be caught too much in the nitty-gritty and not appreciate the greater picture. I believe the nature of housing events and programming can aid in his ability to relax and see the bigger picture.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think he would be better fit with first years. Jake forms interactive communities, and combined with the energy of freshmen, some magic can really happen. He works best with people who have interest and competence. He can handle people who are apathetic, but Jake appears to focus his time on tasks with value returns (ie- not forcing someone to do an event that they do not want to attend).

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. Jake has a fantastic skills set to create a community and facilitate organic development and inclusivity. At times, he can be caught too much in the details, but I  believe any HD can assist in his development of appreciating the bigger picture. Jake is obedient and thorough with his work, and innovative when provided the opportunity. Very self- sufficent. Great asset to any staff.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I think Jake has learned a lot over the past three years and he is ready to serve others in the capacity as a SSM.
