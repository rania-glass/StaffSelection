I have included a letter of recommendation below that can provide more detail.  If you have any additional questions or would like to contact me for clarification, I am happy to assist.   It is with great pride that I recommend Jon Faris for the position of Student Staff Member. I have known Jon for four years; two years as a student and one as a lab assistant. He was always a high achiever in his chemistry and AP Chemistry classes and both were quite challenging.  He proved himself time and time again with his hard work and perseverance.  These qualities earned him the title of AP Scholar with Distinction and a place in the National Honor Society in which he served as vice president.  Jon was also a lab assistant in my classes for one academic year.  I found him to be very honest, reliable and hard working.  	Jon has many strengths.  He is a conscientious student who excels in his studies.  He is extremely bright, dedicated, reliable and honest.  He has a true gift for science and is a student that really enjoys the challenges of learning in and out of the classroom. I enjoyed having him in class and find his personality and commitment refreshing.  Anytime I have asked Jon for assistance, he is always willing to do whatever is needed.  He works well on his own and in a team.  He is very responsible for completing his own work and is consistently willing to help the others around him to accomplish a common goal.  His peers admire him, and this admiration is well deserved.   	Jon has an incredible outlook on life.  He approaches his projects, both personal and academic, with a positive attitude that provides a welcoming atmosphere for his fellow students in which to participate.   He does what it takes to do a job, do it well, and do it right the first time.  He is not afraid to ask questions or to think outside of the box; which is a terrific combination.  I have no doubt that Jon will be a leader and an innovator in his future endeavors, including this job opportunity.  Jon is also a well-rounded student. Jon always goes out of his way to participate in many extracurricular activities such as Key club, chess club, science club, ski club, varsity baseball, and varsity cross country. During his time in high school he was employed outside of the school day and volunteered regularly in his community.   Jon tutored younger students in our district and was a camp counselor for our fifth graders. He also participated in our Mentoring and More program that helps younger students find role models in our community.  As you can see, Jon continues to strive for a life balance that shows a maturity level beyond his years.  He would be the perfect candidate to help serve students within your university. In closing, I ask that you give Jon very careful consideration for the position of Student Staff Member.  I am sure that he will impress you as he has me.  He is an excellent candidate that has only my highest respect and admiration.
