For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Arjun was a student in my Fall 2015 English 1101 class, and is currently a student in my Spring 2016 English 1102 class. I have known him since August of 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Arjun is thoughtful, articulate, and responsible. During my classes, there are several group projects, and Arjun could always be counted on to take a leadership role, helping to guide his team towards project completion. He responsibly completed his work for this class and was very reflective and thoughtful in all his work.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I believe that Arjun has great leadership potential, and that a position as SSM could help him to develop this. While he does a great job of exhibiting leadership within group projects, he could take more initiative and leadership in general classroom discussions. He has so many great ideas to share, and I hope he finds more opportunities to speak up and express these ideas.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I have only observed Arjun working with other first-year GT students, but I did note he seemed able to work with both highly-motivated and less-motivated students and that he seemed able to work thoughtfully with students from a variety of cultural backgrounds.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Arjun would make a good SSM because he is responsible, thoughtful, articulate, and friendly. He is also highly motivated and responsible, with excellent leadership potential.
