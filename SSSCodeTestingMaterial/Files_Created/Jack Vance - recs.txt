I was jacks youth pastor for seven years where he served in leadership for 3 1 2 years

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been Jack's youth pastor for seven years. In that time he served 3 1 2 years as a small group leader of middle school boys. I have seen him grow up and been very involved in his life. I have seen him in the mission field and in other settings.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
 Jack is extremely confident and friendly. He always does a task to the best of his ability. I've known Jack to be someone who can be counted on in big situations. He is someone we have trusted in leadership roles with younger students.  He is quick thinking and enjoys solving problems. He is also someone that gives great advice in time of need.   Based off of the description of the SSM I would say he would be a very strong candidate.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
 Jack is extremely gifted and almost everything he does. His problem-solving skills are such a huge asset in his life. With that comes the growing edge of knowing when to solve a problem and when to listen.  Jack also works extremely hard knowing the correct way of doing things.  When a task is given that to Jack does not follow the logically best way of doing something he will let you know of a better way. He usually does this was with tact but can air occasionally in this field. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
In Jack's leadership role of the church he worked with a variety of personalities of younger students. He worked extremely well with the students. It is very hard for me to fathom that he would have difficulty working with either upperclassman or freshman or peers. He is someone that can be heard in any of those situations.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Jack is an excellent example to other people. He is trustworthy honest hard-working hilarious just an all-around great guy. If you want someone who students can go to that will give sound advice and will work very hard at finding solutions when problems arise, Jack is your man.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
On overall recommendation, I would give Jack 9.5 out of 10.  I have served with thousands of students and only a small handful would I recommend as highly!
