Teacher, Sponsor and Faculty Advisor

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Shan for over 8 years as his teacher, faculty advisor, theatre director, choreographer and thespian sponsor at Lakeview Academy.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Shan is intelligent, a natural leader, charismatic, diligent, dedicated, approachable and one of the most genuinely honest and caring people I have ever known.  He was involved with many academic, extracurricular and leadership organizations and was incredibly respected by both peers and faculty alike.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Shan is well-rounded so his areas of development are few in my opinion.  I think that he may take to heart if someone is in crisis or has needs that may be out of his control.  I know that it bothers him to not be able to resolve a situation and he may tend to dwell on this.  However, I am confident that Shan would know to get a person in crisis to the right help and support group and therefore would help in a positive way.   A position such as this would benefit him by forcing him to work with compassion and diligence while learning to compartmentalize and 'let go' when the situation is passed on if need be.  It could also reinforce that his natural empathetic nature is a wonderful trait to have.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Truthfully, Shan works well with many different types of people.  I feel that he would be able to relate with and help to guide a wide variety of residents.  He is empathetic and patient with those who need it, he is energetic and enthusiastic when the situation calls for it, and he can take charge and make a stand when needed.  Shan can work with both adults and peers and is able to relate to them in equal ways.  I honestly have never heard anyone who has had an issue with him- he just seems to get along with everyone.  The only people that I have ever seen him take issue with are those who are negative and or abusive to others and even then, he was able to address them in a respectful but firm way to work toward altering the offensive behavior.   Therefore, I truly feel that Shan would be able to handle the situations and different personalities that this position would require him to deal with and lead.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Shan understands hard work and organization and comprehends the need to balance policies and regulations with personalization, humor and a genuine attitude.  He is quick with a smile, an idea, a helping hand and a solution.  Working with him and watching him grow into the young man that he is today is proof that he would be a great SSM.  He knows how to relate to the 'outcast' as well as the 'in crowd' and has real world experiences and insights that set him apart from the norm.  He is wise and kind beyond his years and his intelligence and humor make him both likable and approachable.  Shan is dedicated, loyal and a true humanitarian who loves to serve others.  He is compelling and draws people in so that they feel a connection.  This charisma backed by genuine character and integrity make Shan an exceptional choice for this position.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I am convinced that Shan Suen would be an incredible asset to the PL or SSM program.  Seeing him be an officer, a leader, STAR Student, a performer, musician and scholar throughout high school while he balanced his family, friends and faith is a testament to his unique and diverse interests and character.  Shan would be an extraordinary benefit to this program and I hope that you will strongly consider him.
