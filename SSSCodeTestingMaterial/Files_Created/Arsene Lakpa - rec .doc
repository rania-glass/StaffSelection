In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known my applicant as a resident since mid August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Arsene is always in a good mood and never hesitates to be social. He takes advantage of open door policy and is kind to his peers. He seems comfortable at Tech and I think he would be able to make others feel welcome and just as comfortable.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Although his attitude is positive at times he jokes around a lot. I understand that this at times isn't helpful especially in professional situations, but to be fair I haven't seen it be a problem yet so it's very possible he is good at only messing around at the right times.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I definitely think he'd be successful with freshman. His personality encourages people to come out of their shells and socialize. However he doesn't seem to be easily disappointed, so I think he'd be fine with upperclassmen as well. The only reason he wouldn't do well with upperclassmen would be because he is kinda goofy sometimes (in a good hilarious way), and I'm concerned they may not respect him they way freshman would.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I definitely think Arsene would make a good SSM. He's caring even when he doesn't have to be and his inviting smile and welcoming personality make it very easy to be comfortable around him.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I understand Arsene is also successful in school, so he can also be a good tutor mentor for his residents.
