In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Shuv for about a year and half. He was one of my residents on my hall last year and got interested in becoming a PL for the upcoming school year. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Shuv is very outgoing and has an appealing personality. He is very reliable, and I can count on him to lend a helping hand when I need one. He is also a strong communicator and a hard worker. I think he could translate these qualities to the SSM position very easily. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think the SSM position will help Shuv develop his leadership qualities. On my floor, he was definitely a team player, but he was not always a leader. By becoming an SSM, I think his leadership skills will flourish. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Because of his age, I think Shuv would be stronger working with upperclass students. He was not living on campus during his sophomore year because he was interning; however, he is interested in working for housing in the upcoming year. Although he is comfortable with and passionate about freshmen activities and involvement because of his freshman year on my floor, I think working with upperclassmen would be a good challenge for him. I think working with freshmen would be good for him because he had a very successful freshman year at Tech and could definitely help residents transition. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Shuv would be a great SSM. He is intelligent, a team player, and would make the effort to have a great community.
