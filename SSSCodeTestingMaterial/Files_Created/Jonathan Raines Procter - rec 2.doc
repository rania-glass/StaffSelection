In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Jonathan is my current resident in Smith. I have known him since the beginning of Fall 2015

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Jonathan is a very fun and open minded person. He is able to connect and relate to people from many different backgrounds and has a great sense of professionalism. He also is involved in multiple clubs and organizations, so he would be able to impart his knowledge to future residents. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As with most SSMs, I anticipate that Jonathan would have to develop his conflict management skills. However, I believe that he will easily improve upon this. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe Jonathan would be better suited to interact with 1st year students.   Jonathan does best when interacting with open-minded people like himself. He enjoys some level of freedom in the things he does, so he would not mesh with individuals who are entirely too controlling. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. Jonathan is a great guy. Throughout the year he has been involved in many hall activities and has made himself an important part of the Smith community. He is able to relate and connect with people from different backgrounds and he is very dependable and would do his best to make sure he fulfills and exceeds the SSM duties.
