In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Elyse is a Federal Work Study student employed in the Office of Legal Affairs..  I have known her since August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Elyse is very friendly, approachable and from conversations with her, I get the impression that she is quite sociable.  Her job here is strictly work related, filing, pulling files, running errands, She is prompt and her attendance is very good.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
The position Elyse holds in this office will not develop her to be a SSM but that is only because work study students as you know do not have to possess leadership, coordination, and or mediation skills for which you are looking. I can only attest to what she does in this office and it is strictly office assistant type work.  

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Elyse works well with others and open to suggestions and she will ask questions if she does not understand.  She has very good communication skills.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I have know Elyse for a very short time but I feel that she could be a good candidate because she is very approachable and friendly, and easy to talk to.
