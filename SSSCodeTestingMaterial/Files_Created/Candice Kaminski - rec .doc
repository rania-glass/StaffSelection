In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been her Peer Leader for a little over a semester now and we interact fairly often.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Candice has many beautiful strengths that would play into her PL position. She is incredibly outgoing to everyone in the hall and she is so welcoming. She is very driven (which really shows in her running for hall council at the same time that she was pledging a sorority and getting involved in many other things on campus) and she is very centered on how she can help people and how she can do more to better herself. Another strength she has is her incredible interpersonal skills. She not only knows how to start a conversation with people, she knows how to instantly go deeper and how to get to the core of how someone is feeling. This is a beautiful strength that would truly help her to excel in the Peer Leader position. She is also very creative and open-minded which would help her with planning events (because she was social chair for hall council). 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I cannot think of any specific areas of improvement for Candice that apply to the SSM position, however, I have noticed that she can occasionally lack confidence. She definitely has enough confidence to make an incredible Peer Leader however she does not always realize how great of a job she is doing. I do not think this will affect her abilities negatively as a peer leader but I believe receiving the position in general will give her that confidence boost she needs to truly excel. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe Candice would be an incredible resource for the first-years specifically, because she will be only a second-year when she starts, so she will easily be able to relate to them. She has made such an inspiring effort this past semester to find herself, get involved, remain balanced, and have a diverse friend group, and I just feel as though she can make such an amazing and valuable impact on any first year she has the opportunity to lead. She has grown so much this year and I am incredibly proud of all that she has done. I believe any first-year would feel 100% comfortable to approach her and I believe she would feel much more confident and comfortable to help first-years than she would for upperclassmen. Nevertheless, I am positive she would be a great candidate for RA as well. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
As I previously stated in my other responses, I think Candice is an incredible candidate for the Peer Leader position. I can confidently say that I would have been blessed to have her as a PL when I was a first year. I think that not only can she give so much to this position, but I believe she is someone that would be able to get so much out of it as well. I have full faith in her ability to whole-heartedly lead and guide anyone that she is able to be a peer leader for and any staff would be beyond lucky to have her. On top of her valuable ability to lead and inspire, she is able to connect with pretty much anyone she comes in contact with and I am sure that she will make a strong effort to become close with her hall director and staff as well. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
If she is accepted to the Peer Leader position, I would love to have her on my staff :D   (Yes I know I probably don't get a choice in this, but I thought I would say it anyway)
