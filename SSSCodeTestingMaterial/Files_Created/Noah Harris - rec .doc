In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been Noah's PL since August, 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Noah is very involved in our floor's community. He is a treasurer for the FFM hall council, but definitely goes the extra mile as far as community development is concerned. Noah constantly strives to go above and beyond his job description as our Treasurer by frequently conducting polls and surveys via our floor's group chat to gauge community opinion about proposed events. He attends almost every floor event and typically encourages others to do so as well. He is attentive, sociable, funny, and a very active, involved resident on our floor. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Noah stands out among our floor community as a leader and facilitator. I think he is an amazing candidate for an SSM position. I cannot think of any qualities that would hinder his success as a PL.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
First-years; Noah is extroverted, confident, and amiable. I believe his possession of these qualities would enable him to connect well with any group of students, but particularly first year students. I think these skills would promote community-building and encourage freshmen students to 'break the ice' with both Noah and their peers more easily. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Noah would make a great SSM. He is confident, competent, and has enough passion to fuel his desire to impact his community for the better. His dedication to the FFM community via his Hall Council Officer position has proven his commitment to working toward a happy, safe environment for all.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
