Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Exec Liaison, SGA involvement

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Since the dawn of the academic year through both RHA and SGA.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Availability and enthusiasm for consultation, as a social resource and as a friend to all. Constantly in common areas talking to people. Always friendly, even in emotionally drained circumstances, and is able to help both directly and subtly.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
May alienate more introverted quiet people initially, due to her extroverted nature. I believe that she would catch on quickly, though.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I would recommend extroverted freshmen, especially, or a sufficiently active thinkbig similar community per her interests. While I feel as though she would be perfectly fine as an apartment RA in other communities, her social  and communication skills are exceptional, especially for a tech student, and such a placement would not take advantage of her abilities.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, absolutely. She seems to naturally demonstrate qualities that I have seen in successful SSMs, namely communication, social interaction, and helpfulness. She is also excellent at an understanding of campus resources, as facilitated through SGA involvement.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Fantastic RHA area council president. She has worked with me more than once to improve the organization; more than willing to go above and beyond. Strongly recommend.
