Teacher SGA Advisor

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Ian since November of 2012. He was active in Blake High school's Student Government Association, of which I was the sponsor. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ian is  very personable and easy to talk to. He is also very understanding and compassionate. Additionally, Ian is able to be flexible in situations where events dictate changing plans at the last minute or rethinking a situation. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Ian could grow more in the areas of organization, eloquence with words in times of stress or pressure, and time management.  He tends to be very direct when he is relaying information, which is a good thing in some ways or instances, but in others, he could improve how he delivers messages.  

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
When Ian served as Student Government vice president and president, he was comfortable working with a very diverse group of students from all age groups and ethnic backgrounds. Because he housed this past experience, I am confident he will be able to step into the role of Peer Leader without any problems what so ever. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do believe that Ian would make a good SSM.  As stated in the previous question, when he served on SGA from 10th through 12th grades, he was very motivated and worked diligently to meet the goals and objectives of our organization.  

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Ian is very compassionate and cares about his community.  He is a good friend to those in his circle, yet he is always open to making that circle bigger.  He is very welcoming and was an outstanding ambassador for the Blake High School community.
