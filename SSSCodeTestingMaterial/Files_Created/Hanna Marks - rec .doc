In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Hanna for over a year, now. Hanna lived on the floor below me last year and often would hang out on our floor lounge and interact with our community very well.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Hanna's strongest characteristics revolve around her ability to communicate and read situations. She excels in both group and individual scenarios, and understands that different situations adhere to different actions. Her word choice and actions are very flexible depending on the context she perceives and her responses are well thought out. Her ability to fit in with a community and foster a community are astounding.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
As an SSM, Hanna would need to work on her time-management skills. Often she swamps herself with classes and extracurriculars. She will need to learn how to better manage her time and organize her priorities so that she dedicates appropriate time to everything and to prevent stress and overload.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Hanna would succeed most with first-year students. She really enjoys being part of a community and being surrounded by others. It's the environment she thrives best in. I feel she would struggle most with residents who just don't want be part of the community and work well with those who want to be involved and want to participate in community builders.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Oh, I believe Hanna would be an amazing SSM. She was always an integral cog in the clock of our community. Her presence just made us feel better. She provides a sense of home and comfort that not a lot of people have, and her ability to relate and carry on a conversation make her one of the best people to talk to here on campus. Her experiences here at Tech, alone, make her a great resource to first-year and upperclass students alike.
