High School Teacher Coach of Dejan

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
4+ years starting with the summer before he entered 9th grade at North Gwinnett H.S.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Dejan has a rare ability to communicate with any person regardless of age or background.  His sense of humor and true compassion allow him to do this.  He is relatable, friendly, and outgoing, but his approach is truly genuine. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Honestly, I would be hard-pressed to come up with an area of development for Dejan in regards to this.  I've known him for quite some time and he has always stood out for the above mentioned reasons, as well as his level of maturity which is beyond his typical peers.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Like I stated before in #9, Dejan has the rare ability to reach all ages and backgrounds.  However, he has great experience in working with freshman at the high school level by using his experiences to teach them.  He was a freshman mentor to students with special needs, as well as to students served in the general education population while in high school.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely!  His compassion and personality would allow him to thrive in this position.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Dejan is the man!  I've been in education for 9 years now, and I have no hesitation in recommending this young man for this job based on what I witnessed him do while in high school at North Gwinnett.
