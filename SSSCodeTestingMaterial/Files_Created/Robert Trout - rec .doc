In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've known Robert for a bit more than a semester now. I'm his peer Leader and also had the privilege of advising him for the Glenn Hall hall council executive board.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Robert is a very kind and empathetic individual. Not only does he pay attention to people's needs and lives, but he is also a strong academic student. He is dedicated, organized, enthusiastic, and overall a great person to be around. I think that as a potential student staff member, he can bring a lot to the table including great social skills and passion. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Robert is a very soft spoken guy. He's not one of those people that will very loudly and enthusiastically welcome you to the hall and try to shake every parent's hand. With this being said, he's very dependable, very trustworthy, and has a lot of passion potential. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I feel like Robert would excel as a peer Leader more than as a RA. With his set of skills he is one that can create a sense of home. I have no doubt that Robert is more than capable of handling anything first year students may have, be it new friendships, academic aid, or even more psychological issues such as homesickness. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that Robert would make a great student staff member since he has expressed his interest in being a peer Leader very early on during the first semester. He is not one that will do it just for the money and I know he'd be a student staff member even if it didn't pay. He's asked me for advice, tips, and what to do during specific situations. This shows me that he is extremely passionate about the position and would do anything to create a warm and tight-knit community.
