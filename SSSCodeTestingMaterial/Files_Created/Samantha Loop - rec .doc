For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Sam has been one of my residents since August 2015. We interact with each other daily and spend a lot of time together in our building. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Sam is by far the most involved resident I had this semester. She has a great energy, she's always up for any event or outing, she talks to everyone and is a very positive  and combinative girl.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
She is very outgoing and might need to work on filtering what she says to everyone. She swears quite a bit, and as a PL that will need to decrease a lot. Just making sure she keeps in mind what kind of influence she might be having in those around her. I am sure that given that responsibility, she will work on this.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Sam would work well with first-years because she is very outgoing and fun, so I think she'd be followed to all the events and make the residents very excited! She is also very loud sometimes, so I would not recommend her to work with Honor's or the buildings where they have classrooms. She will get everyone involved and bonding in a lounge somewhere and it might not me adequate for those types of residence halls.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. Like mentioned, Sam is very outgoing, fun and involved in her community. She is the one person I go to first if I need a volunteer, if I hear about some audition or try outs, because I know she will consider and most likely get involved. She knows many people around BSH area, PLs and residents, and everyone knows her around. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
The only thing she would have to work on is her language use, and what she says to others. She is never rude, nothing like that. She is just very open about her personal life and that might need to be kept more personal once she is a SSM, as an example  and role model for her residents.
