In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've known him since the beginning of the semester, during move in. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Dami is very involved on campus. He makes a good impression on everyone that he meets. He has a very good charisma that develops from his strong personality. I've always been able to have good conversations with him about what he is doing and how he is managing himself. He seems to be adjusting to college well and finding a good grounding for himself, something that is tough and will be useful as an SSM. I think that Dami also demonstrates a good ability to sit down and talk with someone. For an initiative of Housing, I had a personal conversation with him and he was very understanding and tried his best to relate to me what he was feeling. His enthusiasm is unrivaled and he would be a phenomenal SSM.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Dami doesn't seem to have the ability to take complete control of a situation. He can also seem to be in his shell but that too is very brief. I believe that these traits could be easily overshadowed by his benefits as an SSM. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Dami could work well with first year students. He is very relatable and would be a good person to come to for advice. He is also very involved and would use that to his benefit with first year students. Being a first year student currently, he would very easily be able to assist students in their transition. I think that Dami has a good sense of his character and who he is. This helps him to make sure that he is staying true to himself while being the best that he can be. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think that Dami would. He is very aware of who he is and will use that to the best of his ability to relate to first year students. He also would use his strengths as a smart and kind person to make students feel safe. Dami would be a great SSM because he knows how to use his strengths in the right situations. With his wonderful personality, Dami would make those around him better and be a great friend to his residents. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I don't think it would be easy to express how well suited Dami is for the job. I am very glad that he is applying because he could make a great impact on any community.
