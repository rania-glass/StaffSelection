N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Emily has lived on my hall since August of 2015 and has been an active hall participant. I engage in conversation with her almost every day of the week.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Emily is very positive and motivated. When she wants something, she is not afraid to go for it, especially when it comes to leadership. For example, she ran for president for Hall Council very confidently (and by all means should have won if all factors of voting had been unbiased). She is now part of FAB and I believe she enjoys it very much.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Emily is not afraid to go for what she wants, but this comes with the drawback that if she does not deem something very important to her, she does not waste her time with it. The only potential fear I have is that she might do less with her hall if she views her duties and presence as unimportant, but I truly do not think that would happen, especially considering the fact that she would be a first-year SSM and therefore have lots of enthusiasm towards her new position.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Emily is very outgoing and approachable, so a good trait for both. I think that since she'll be a second year, she will be able to relate to the freshmen the best. But her openness would also allow her to bond early with older students, especially because she knows many older girls from her sorority and socializes with them on a regular basis.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I truly think that Emily would make a great SSM, especially a PL. She seems to have a good balance between her academic and social life, and I believe that she would be able to fit her SSM duties into her life without much trouble, as well.
