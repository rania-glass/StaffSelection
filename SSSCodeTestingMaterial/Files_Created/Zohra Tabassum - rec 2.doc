In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Zohra throughout the Fall 2015 semester at Georgia Tech, because I have served as her peer leader.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Zohra is one of the friendliest and most social residents on the hall. She is very eager to engage with others on our floor and she often initiates community building activities. Her personality is bubbly and inviting. She can also be serious when she needs to be. She works well in teams, as I have seen her work well with others when doing group problems. I see leadership in her in the way she conducts herself on the daily basis.

Zohra has a fun-loving personality. Occasionally she may be a little loud when joking around with friends.

I think that Zohra would work well with any type of resident, because her personality is adaptable. She would work especially well with first-years because of her ability to create community.  I think that Zohra would work well with any personality type. She likes to laugh so she would work best with energetic people.

Yes. Zohra has such a kind heart and the drive to understand and encourage others. She genuinely cares about and respects others. She is not afraid to speak up when something is wrong, and often speaks up about difficult topics during hall meetings. As an SSM, Zohra would take the position seriously, yet embrace the fun side. She would treat all residents with dignity. I believe that she would follow housing policy and display leadership to her residents.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Zohra is really interested in diversity. She participated in a talk that we had about 'Culture not a costume', where she openly but respectfully expressed her opinions. I saw traits of leadership in the way that she was about to direct the conversation. I also saw interpersonal skills, maturity and confidence in the way that she was able to respectfully disagree and or agree with others. opinions
