For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I taught her in ENGL 1101 last semester and have her for ENGL 1102 this semester.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
My classes involve a lot of group and partnered activities. To be honest, there are students that others generally do not want to be partnered with because of misunderstanding social cues or other tendencies. Mykala was not only willing to partner with such students but actively seemed to seek out and engage with those who were most clearly crying out for engagement in potentially off-putting ways. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Mykala had difficulty with completing one of her assignments that she approached with extreme creativity, but also ended up setting up a larger project than she could manage. I think this is one of the priceless things you learn in college and I could imagine her succeeding in powerful ways as a student leader.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Mykala seemed comfortable with every group that she engaged with during the semester, but as someone who was a Resident Assistant for 3 years in college, I could see her being a kind and welcoming resource for first-years.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
In my experience as a Resident Assistant, I was surprised by how much creativity was part of the job. I enjoyed creating social projects and community spirit through art installations and nonsense games. I could see Mykala doing a far better job of this than I ever managed. She is an exceptional artist, but also studies engineering. I think she would engage students across the spectrum of disciplines and she has the humor to create a relaxed environment for her peers.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
The above question also reminded me of several conversations I had with Mykala concerning social justice, fashion, music, and drug culture. I think she has a wide array of interests and is curious about people in way that would make her a strong fit for the job.
