In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Sujal for 2 years. I have worked with him directly in the Spring and Fall semesters of 2015, during which he held the position of chapter treasurer.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
In my experience with working with him, Sujal has shown himself to be organized and responsible. He also communicates well with those around him and works efficiently as part of a team.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Sujal needs to work on his confidence when it comes to dealing with extroverted people.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Sujal would probably work best with upperclassman that are already established. His somewhat withdrawn personality would make it difficult for him to introduce first-years to campus. It also means that he works best with introverts like himself, as opposed to extroverts.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I feel he would make a good RA for upperclassman. I believe that he is organized and responsible enough to handle the duties of an RA in terms of organizing events and handling paperwork. He is also reasonably approachable. My main concerns lie with ability to mediate conflicts and bring enthusiasm given his introverted personality.
