Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
I fully intend to hire him when he graduates.  He is BY FAR the best intern we have ever had - the ONLY one we have ever had that I would allow to talk directly to customers (US and foreign Aerospace Managers).  The all-excellent rating is no joke or an exaggeration.
