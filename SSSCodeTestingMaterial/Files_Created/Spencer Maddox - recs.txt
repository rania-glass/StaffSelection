In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
They are always visible and helpful with different people in the hall. They also suggest ideas and take initiative to make sure that people get to know him and how he can help them. He is very friendly and always available to help out and reaches out to a wide variety of people despite different backgrounds and interests. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think this applicant can learn different ways to have effective conversations with multiple types of people. Although this applicant can talk to all types of people they can learn how to make these conversations more effective. In addition, I think they can learn more about resources on campus and how to plug people in to different resources and clubs.

I believe that this candidate would be successful with all types of residents but in particular first years. He really helped make the floor what it is this and I think he would really excel in a first year environment. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. He is a very active member in the community and makes the effort to be as much of a leader in the floor as he can. He has all of the qualities needed in a good SSM and he is really willing to learn and work to make sure that he can be a great SSM.
