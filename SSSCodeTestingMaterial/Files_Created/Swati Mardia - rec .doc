In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Swati since August 2015 when she was a student in my Fall Engl 1101 course. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Swati is very responsible and organized. She works very hard to complete the tasks that have been assigned to her thoroughly and expertly to the best of her ability. I was consistently impressed with her communication skills throughout the semester, both her communication with me and with her peers. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Because Swati is very thorough and devoted to completing tasks and projects, working with groups tends to be a bit difficult and even frustrating for her, particularly if those in her group are not as hardworking as she expects them to be. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Swati would work well with other hardworking, thorough, attentive residents who are eager to go above and beyond in their academic social responsibilities. In addition, Swati would work well with international students, as she has experienced navigating this campus and socializing with others who identify as such. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Swati would make a good SSM because she tackles all of her responsibilities with enthusiasm and devotion. She will make her role as a mentor and social facilitator to her fellow residents a high priority .
