In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known her for one semester. She has been my resident for that time period. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Shivani is someone that always has a great attitude and can cheer up anybody. She had a rough time initially, but really learned from it and is now more confident than ever. She was struggling with adjusting to college life but because of that, I believe that she will be able to connect a lot better with future residents. She would be able to provide great advice and be able to serve as a real role model. She works hard academically and in her extra curriculars.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I honestly cannot think of anything she could develop. She is very social, smart, participates and helps in floor events and is great to talk to. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Shivani would be great with first years. She would be able to help them in their struggles from a first hand experience. Shivani would plan great floor events and would be a great resource for first years. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. I believe that she would be amazing SSM. Like stated before, she is easy to talk to and would be extremely resourceful for future first years.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
All in all, I believe that Shivani would be a great Peer Leader.
