In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have worked with Jin for one semester as the SSM hall council adviser, she serving as the meetings coordinator.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
The most outstanding qualities about Jin are her attention to detail and motivation to do a good job regardless of the situation. Having observed four hall councils in total, the one Jin contributes to is easily the most efficient and effective, much of which can be attributed to her initiative. Even outside of her duties, Jin sets a shining example of a model student and human being in general. She is pleasant, courteous, and approachable for scholastic wisdom or help.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
One thing about Jin is that she does not have a type A personality, which I believe to be a boon when considering apartment culture. Instead, she leads by stoicism and exudes determination. Initial relationships with Jin may be slower in developing, but once connected, her professionalism is clear and even the least aware resident would realize her caring goes deeper than surface level.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Jin would be a very approachable RA, but I don't  doubt she would do a great job as a PL also. Whatever she sets her mind to, she does.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Jin receives my highest recommendation as a SSM. Committed, clever, and flexible, any staff would be fortunate to accept her.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Jin has already worked with many RAs on my staff to organize events, some even set up days in advance. She is familiar with the duties of an RA.
