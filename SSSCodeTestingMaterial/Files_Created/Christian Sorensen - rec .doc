In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Christian since August of 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Christian is one of the most approachable, friendly residents on my hall. He is extremely easy to talk to and always going out of his way to engage with others in our community. He is also involved in a variety of activities outside of exclusively academic endeavors, especially intramurals, all the while maintaining a great GPA. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Although Christian is an amazing candidate for a Peer Leader, I think he could improve his confidence in interacting with other residents on the hall. I believe this opportunity would empower Christian to work toward improving his confidence. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Because of Christian's amiable and open personality, I believe he would be most effective in working toward bringing together communities in the freshmen dorms. Due to his sometimes soft spoken persona however, I do not think he would be as suited to working with potentially intimidating upperclass students.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Christian would make an excellent SSM. He is a well-liked, respected member of our floor's community and I find him to be very well-rounded. This well-roundedness makes him more relatable to others in our community and helps to foster stronger bonds among his peers. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Christian not only manages to maintain his social life, an impressive, consistent gym routine, and hobbies, but also has held a high GPA during his first semester at tech. I think this proves not only his work ethic, but his dedication to leading a balanced life during his time at Georgia Tech and beyond.
