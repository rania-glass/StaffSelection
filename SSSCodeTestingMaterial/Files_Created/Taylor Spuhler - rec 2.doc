In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
She has been a resident on my floor this past semester.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
She is very friendly and outgoing. She is easy to talk to and wants to get to know everyone. She likes getting to know girls on our floor. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think she is overly involved in everything. She might need to work on her time management. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
She would work well with freshmen or upper class students because she is friendly enough and fun enough to work with freshmen, but she also is involved in so many other things that maybe less hands-on would be good for if she was with upper class students. She works well with people that have dedication and tell her straight up what is required. She doesn't work well with people that are on the fence and don't really have a plan. She also doesn't work well with people that don't follow through on their plans. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes to a certain degree. She is very outgoing and is fun to hang out with. However, because she is involved in other activities, I feel like sometimes she might not be as available to her residents if needed. However, when she is in the dorm, I think she would be a great PL. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
She really wants to be a PL, but if she doesn't get it, I really think she would be a fantastic RA. She really wants the job and has wanted it since the first day. So I think she would be a good SSM in whatever capacity she is chosen for.
