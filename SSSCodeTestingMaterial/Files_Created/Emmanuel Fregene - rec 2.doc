In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Emmanuel since he started his freshman year at Tech this past semester. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Emmanuel has a very cool demeanor. He stays calm and assesses the situation before making any conclusions; something that is rare for someone his age. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
He definitely takes some time to open up to people and can be reserved at times as well. He is most comfortable with people he has known for a longer period of time, but he definitely mixes well with any group of people. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think he would work well with first-years as well as international students. Like I stated earlier, he has a very calm demeanor and I believe that that trait can come in handy with both sets of students. He is also very willing to learn more about people and that sets him apart for sure. He  might have a harder time with upper class-men who may not take him seriously or think he is a push over since he can be reserved. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, Emmanuel has shown a lot of maturity in this one semester at Tech and continues to do so outside of the dorm. He has chosen a few organizations that he is very passionate about and continues to work on those projects on his own time. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
