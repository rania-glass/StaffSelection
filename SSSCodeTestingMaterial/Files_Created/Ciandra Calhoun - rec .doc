In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been her Peer Leader for the past four months. I have watched develop from being worried and scared of this new life to being more confident. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ciandra is very down to earth and easy to talk to. She is someone that can be approached for any help and does not hesitate to assist in anyway she can. She is also very good at talking people through their problems instead of giving direct answers. Ciandra is calm and fun to talk to.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
One area where she can grow is in her knowledge about Tech in general. Although her personality is great for the job, she can learn a little bit more about Tech and everything it offers. She has not had much time to grasp that since she has only been at Tech for four months, but given time, I am sure she will gain that knowledge as well 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that she will work well with upper classmen. She works well with people that need help but not from the beginning.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that she would be a good SSM. She would be a great person to talk to and would help anyone that needs it. She is very outgoing and residents would be able to talk to her freely.
