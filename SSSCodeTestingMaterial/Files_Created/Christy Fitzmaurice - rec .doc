In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Christy was my resident this past fall semester. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Christy has such a wonderful personality and already has a passion for housing as a resident. She tries to get to know everyone in her community and really takes advantage of what housing has to offer. I believe this will translate into great programming skills that are tailored to her residents needs. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Since she has been a resident for a while, she will have to work on translating that into an SSM role and the extra responsibility that holds but I think she will handle that beautifully! 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think that from her two years living in Fulmer Christy could be successful with every type of resident. I believe her personality is diverse and works with everywhere personality as well. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
100% if I ever needed something this last semester Christy was always there to help. She had a great presence In the hall and was present at every single event. She already is passionate about housing. She cared about the residents and the community as a whole. Christy would be an invaluable addition to a staff next year.
