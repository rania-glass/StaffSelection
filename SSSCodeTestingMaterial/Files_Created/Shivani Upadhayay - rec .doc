In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Fellow peer throughout middle school and high school. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
One of Shivani’s most valuable strengths, which makes her so well suited to be SSM, is her energy. Whether it is inside or outside the classroom, she carries a truly motivational energy, wanting to do her best in whatever situation she is put in.  Furthermore, her energy is not one that is self-centered but instead inspiring, making her energy contagious to those around her. As someone who is older than Shivani and has given her previous guidance, I still look up to her when it comes to her energy. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
One area of development for Shivani as a potential SSM is her stern mentality. She takes all words and actions with a serious mindset, so something that one may say as a joke or no malicious intent can at times upset or offend Shivani. However, I don't think this is a crucial area of development and since it's a weakness she's admitted to before as well, I have confidence she will be able to overcome this. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Though I believe she will be successful with any type of resident, I think she will be appreciated the most among first year students. Her open-mindedness and willing to help others would be greatly useful to first year students who are making the transition from high school to college, in which many problems can arise. Whether it is conflict between roommates, academic stress, or homesickness, Shivani has always been proficient at working with all types of people. Thus I believe that having a successful SSM, like Shivani, could truly improve students’ first year. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I am without a doubt confident that Shivani will be a qualified SSM. As someone who has known her for over seven years and is currently living in a college dormitory, I strongly believe Shivani will be apt to perform her roles as a SSM for residents.
