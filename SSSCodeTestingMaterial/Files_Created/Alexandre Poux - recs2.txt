Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Community Member (lived on the same hall as first-years) and friend

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Alex for about a year and a half, as a friend and as a member of our hall community  for our first year.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Alex is extremely friendly and approachable, and is always happy to help. His open personality and enthusiasm makes him an enjoyable person to be around and to interact with.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I feel that Alex could improve by taking more initiative to branch out to new people and connecting with them. If someone new approaches him, he will be very sociable, but I have not often seen him take the first step to connect with others.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Alex would be successful with both first-years and upperclass students, but more so with upperclass students. This is because I feel that first-years would need someone who needs to reach out to them more, and that is an area in which he needs improvement.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Alex's ability to be social, kind, and understanding will make him a good SSM. Residents will have no problem coming to him for issues and I am confident in his ability to help them.
