Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
I am a full-time attorney at Jones Day, and teach the pre-law section of GT1000 at Georgia Tech.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
He was one of my students last fall. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Mitchell is responsible. He is approachable and and students would trust him. He also demonstrates care and enthusiasm.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
This would be a great way for Mitchell to become more involved on campus. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Because Mitchell is confident and mature, he would be able to work with any residents. But, because he is in his first year, he may connect with first- year students best.  Although, Mitchell is social and friendly, he is soft spoken and does not dominate a group conversation. I think this would make him particularly great at working with students who are shy or quiet because they would not find him intimidating. He would be very good at listening to the students. This would also allow him to bring a different personality to a group of SSMs.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. Mitchell would be a great SSM. I taught Mitchell in class every week last semester. He always came to class on time and was prepared. He was engaged in class and asked great questions. He also sat with different students in class every week in an effort to get to know all of his classmates.   Mitchell had a very successful first semester at Georgia Tech. He got a 3.84 in Mechanical Engineering.  He also has experience tutoring and leading groups of students. Because of this, he would be a fantastic resource for students who are struggling academically at Georgia Tech. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Mitchell has all of the attributes you would want in a SSM: leadership experience, approachable, dependable, and enthusiastic. Please reach out with any questions. Thank you!
