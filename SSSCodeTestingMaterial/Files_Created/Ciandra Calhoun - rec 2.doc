In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've known Ciandra since she was in middle school (5+ years). Her brother and my son played sports together. She has also worked for me (Technology Services Organization) as a federal work study student assistant .

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ciandra is an extremely well rounded student. Her ability to successfully balance her academics, extra-curricular activities and work life is her major strength. Her grades are outstanding and her involvement in extra-curricular activities ranges from sports to academic clubs to volunteer work. She has even held leadership positions in some of these activities including Student Government, National Honor Society, and Friends Club.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Areas of development for Ciandra as a potential SSM are becoming a 'resource' to her peers and becoming knowledgeable about the services offered by Georgia Tech.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Ciandra would be able to work with any type of resident because of her warm, friendly and approachable personality. If I had to, I would choose 'mostly first-years' considering she is experiencing her first year at Georgia Tech. She has the ability to work with various personalities as evident in her involvement in varying organizations (i.e. JV and Varsity Volleyball, Cheerleading, Drama Club, Beta Club, Spanish Club,  Friends Club, Project Open Hand), and her employment in a professional work environment. During her employment, she worked with the information technology staff as well as the faculty, staff and students in the College of Computing. She worked with little to no training and minimal supervision. No task was too difficult for Ciandra to accomplish. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. For all the reasons I've previously stated, I definitely believe Ciandra would be an excellent SSM. In addition, she wants to make a positive impact in other peoples' lives and have a fulfilling campus career which is inclusive of 'being involved.' All of her previous experience has prepared her for this role and her success in it.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
It has been a pleasurable experience watching Ciandra grow into a fine young lady. Her successes have been many and will continue to grow.
