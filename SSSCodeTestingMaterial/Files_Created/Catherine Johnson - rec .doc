In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Catherine has been both my student and worked for me as a TA

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Catherine is extremely outgoing and a natural leader. As a student, she lead a group of 4 other students on a semester long project. As a TA she is welcoming and helps her students as best she can or refers them to the correct resources to find answers to the questions.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Catherine struggles a bit when she is in a group where she is not at least even in experience levels. She seems to lose a bit of confidence when faced with graduate students in our TA prep sessions. However, in the classroom she does well with students who are you her year and below.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Given her age, I think Catherine would work well with mostly first year students. She does well with people who are open and receptive and willing to listen. Student's who are more advanced in their studies may be less inclined to listen.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Catherine would be a phenomenal SSM. As I mentioned, her leadership skills in a peer group were exemplary. She is meticulous in her work as a TA which I believe would translate to following regulations and procedures well. Finally, she has a fun, happy personality that makes her instantly approachable. I recommend her most highly.
