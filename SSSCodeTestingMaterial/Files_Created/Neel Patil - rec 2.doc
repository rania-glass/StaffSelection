In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known this applicant for about six years now through both curricular and extracurricular activities. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
This student is a kind, genuine, and incredibly approachable individual. He also has a great sense of humor and a very charismatic personality which will allow him to foster great relationships with residents. Neel is an excellent student with great morals which I believe will allow him to be a role model and mentor figure to residents.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Neel is very much a people person and strives to please all which is great in many situations but not always the best trait to have as an SSM. He struggles to say no, but as a hardworking individual I have no doubt that he would take this job very seriously and execute his role as an SSM according to protocol in challenging situations. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Due to Neel's charismatic personality he has the ability to connect with people of all personalities as long as they make themselves available. With that said, Neel would mesh well with outgoing first-year students looking to get involved on campus. Enthusiasm about school, activities, Georgia Tech, and college life in general are traits that would really work well with Neel's personality type. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe this candidate would make and excellent SSM as I have known him to be the focused, driven, yet also fun-loving friend of mine for the past six years. Neel is intelligent, wise, and hardworking which are all desirable traits when looking for leaders in these first year resident halls. Apart from his leadership qualifications, Neel is also a pleasure to work with. He would mesh beautifully with the SSMs on my staff or any staff which I believe is just as important as the work we do in our residence halls. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Neel is a wonderful student, team-member, and above all friend. He genuinely care about the people in his life and fully invests himself in any activity he commits to which is why I believe he would make a great Student Staff Member.
