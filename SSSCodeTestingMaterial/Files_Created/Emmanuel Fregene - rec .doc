In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Emmanuel for less than a year but I have worked with him closely and know his family as well.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I was very impressed with Emmanuel's demeanor.  He is polite at all times and exudes a calm control of himself and his environment. Working for me, I found him level headed, diligent and a problem solver.  He is cheerful and very approachable. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I'm not positive I understand the question.  Do you mean the areas he should improve on?  If so, I believe Emmanuel may have to learn more to do all the functions of an RA.  But given his intelligence and attitude, I'm sure he'll do well.   

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe Emmanuel would be best suited to first year students.  It seems to me his personality would not command the attention and compliance of students far above his age and grade.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes I do.  My own son, just a few years older than Emmanuel, was a RA for two years at SPSU (now KSU).  I saw first hand how he interacted with first year students.  I can see Emmanuel connecting and befriending with other students in the same manner.  He is a quiet leader and a young man of integrity.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I also know Emmanuel' s family.  It is easy to see where he get's his solid values and character.  I feel confident that Emmanuel would put his heart, soul and considerable intelligence into the roll of RA.  He's a fine young man.
