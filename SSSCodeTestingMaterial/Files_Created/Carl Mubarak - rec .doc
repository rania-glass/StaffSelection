What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Approachable and friendly define Carl perfectly. He is a good listener and skilled at keeping up conversation, all adding up to an individual with a knack for building relationships. Carl has a contagious vision for our hall this year, the kind of 'contagious' that gets the most hesitant resident to come to hall council or the resident too cool for a hall event to attend. Carl also has the initiative to plan events and fulfil his responsibilities without being told. He has taken a strong interest in our community and building it this year, so given the opportunity I have no doubt he will be very effective when given residents of his own. Carl is also no stranger to diversity. He has made a point to befriend some of the most diverse residents on the hall and does a great job interacting with them.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I haven't seen Carl use many of the campus resources such as counseling or tutoring, so I think he would need training in where to refer students in what situations. Carl is also not extremely involved on campus, so while he will have ample time for his residents, I fear he won't have a lot to offer with respect to finding and joining student organizations.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Carl would have the easiest time connecting with first-year students. Carl looks for mentorship frequently and I can see him willing to give it to new students. I think Carl would take full advantage of any freshman who are even somewhat social, using whatever time he has with them to get them to buy into the hall's community. I have never seen Carl have issues working with any personality type, but I would expect he would most likely run into issues with a strong regal or 'too cool' personality type. For example, he might not be able to sway residents very stubbornly avoiding hall programming, as he might be too passive to get them to come.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Carl was one of the first of my residents to go out of his way to build relationships with residents throughout the hall. He regularly attends hall events and will be leading his own this spring. Carl is always agreeable and friendly with an aptitude for connecting with all different types of people. I can see Carl as a great leader for a hall, enthusiastic about building a strong community and serious about his responsibilities as a university employee.
