For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
PL in the Freshman Experience who is a friend and colleague of the applicant

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Shannon for about a year now. We are both members of the Catholic Student Organization and have become friends through our involvement in that organization.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Shannon possesses many strengths that would make her a great candidate for the SSM position. First, she is extremely motivated and well-organized. If she were hired for this position, she would make it a priority of hers to approach her job with the utmost care and give it the attention that is necessary and it deserves. Second, she has a very outgoing personality and has many experiences working with diverse groups of people.  This will be a valuable trait for the SSM position because it means that Shannon will possess the qualities necessary to work well with other staff members and to reach out to and build meaningful relationships with her residents.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think Shannon encompasses many of the things that the Department of Housing looks for and values in an SSM. She has had many experiences and has adopted and outlook that would make her an excellent addition to any housing staff. If there were areas Shannon could work on to develop her strengths as an SSM, I would suggest she make sure that not all residents will respond in the same way to outgoing behavior, so sometimes you need to be engaging, but also reserved when trying to develop relationships with residents who tend to be shy.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Shannon's personality type as I've described above would be most well-suited for the Peer Leader position in the Freshman Experience. A Peer Leader is someone who needs to be a role model in his or her community, someone who is able to help Freshmen get acclimated to Georgia Tech and build up a strong community and or close personal bonds among residents and student staff. Because of Shannon's bubbly personality, outgoing persona, and caring nature, I think this will be an excellent fit for the Freshman Experience.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
In summary, I believe that Shannon would make a great SSM, especially a PL. Having worked with Shannon on numerous functions for the Catholic Student Organization and having observed her own presentations and work, she really dedicates a lot of heart and time to that which she cares about, and I know the SSM position is very meaningful to her. Her qualities and attributes are definitely those which will direct Freshmen or any residents for that matter towards having a fruitful and enjoyable dorm and college experience.
