N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Aradhana is one of my residents this year, and I have known her for 1 year. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Aradhana is friendly around the hall and generally approachable. There were two issues in her quad this semester, both of which she handled very well through good mediation skills. The first issue was a cleanliness issue caused by one of the roommates. She discussed it with the roommate directly while during the meeting where we created a roommate contract, which takes a lot of courage. The other issue was that one of the roommates was struggling with school and showing symptoms of depression. She and one of her roommates approached me privately about the issue to voice their concern. I can imagine her practicing the same awareness and compassion for her future residents. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Aradhana became far more engaging and communicative with other residents in the hall as the semester went on, but she was shy at the beginning. This tendency may lead her to have a difficult time in the beginning of the year when everyone is new. She may do better in this position than I think because she would be one of the oldest in the hall, but my initial observations show that she may need some tips on how to intentionally engage and become comfortable with her residents the first few weeks of school.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Aradhana is liked by all of her roommates (who each have very different personalities) and I frequently see her with people from inside and outside the hall, so I imagine she could work well with any personality. Given the way she treats me--which is very respectfully, sometimes 'overly' respectfully--I don't think she would be totally comfortable approaching residents older than her about conflicts. She would probably feel most comfortable with first-year students.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. Aradhana has been very responsible, kind, and engaging in the hall. She is easily the biggest 'mediator' of her quad where each of her roommates has very different personalities. Tolerance and mediation are second nature for her, and this would be really good for being an SSM. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
While I can vouch for her enthusiasm and ability to work with people on an individual basis, I do not know how she would be on teams (i.e. working with her co-SSMs). She is definitely worth interviewing, and that is something I would ask about!

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
The only part I cannot speak to regarding Aradhana's qualifications is her ability to work collaboratively with others, support her colleagues, etc. This is something I would ask about in the interview to gauge how well she would be able to work with a Co-RA PL!
