Nothing that I saw when working with him struck me as holding him back for being an SSM.

From what I have seen with him providing positive assistance and explanations I think he would do the best with helping first-years get used to Tech.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
The only reason I rated Diversity & Social Justice Awareness as average was while I have seen him work wonderfully with a very diverse team. I however did not have experience (nor was I in a position to) with him specifically dealing with Diversity & Social Justice Awareness.
