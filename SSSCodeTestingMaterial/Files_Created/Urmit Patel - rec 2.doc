In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Urmit has been a resident of mine for the previous four semesters.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Urmit has a fundamental knowledge and understanding regarding diversity and privilege. He uses this knowledge to converse with me and other residents in the hall in a very positive manner. He tries to learn who we are and why we do what we do. To this end, I think he will be an exceptional SSM.  Additionally, Urmit is very detail oriented and good at managing time. Through conversations regarding his class work and his work for Delta, I have understood that Urmit likes to get things done ahead of time so he may review his work to ensure it is complete to the best of his abilities. I believe these strengths will translate to the life of an SSM very well. When it comes to FLS forms, inventories, etc, I see Urmit completing these forms of documentation accurately and on time.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think Urmit needs to work on his short-term communication skills. I feel he is very good and deep and long conversations. However, I think he could be better at small talk, which as an SSM is important when interacting with Residents in passing.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Urmit would be great with first-year students. He has a lot of energy and enthusiasm and I think this would be great for working with new students. Additionally, I feel Urmit would enjoy working in the PL role. Overall, I think Urmit can work with any personality. He has friends from the entire spectrum and they all get along with him well.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, based on the aforementioned skills, I believe Urmit will be a great SSM. He has the skills necessary to both work and live with his residents and to also complete housing related documentation, both required for the job. Additionally, he has the energy and enthusiasm to work through any problem the job will bring him.
