In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Jordan as a resident since Fall semester 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Jordan is a compassionate, committed, and involved GT student. He is a valuable member of our hall and a leader both in his classes and in his on-campus activities. He is devoted to succeeding scholastically, and is knowledgeable about the educational resources available to students here. He is also involved in the Aerospace Engineering Student Advisory Council, where he works to facilitate communication between the AE department administration and AE students. Jordan has also told me about his history of leading student organizations back in High School, where his community service work benefited Habitat for Humanity. On our hall, Jordan makes an effort to attend Hall Council meetings and keeps up-to-date with the latest HC bills. He is a valuable member of our floor community and spends time with us whenever he can. Jordan truly has many important SSM strengths: leadership ability, knowledge, and commitment.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
One area in which Jordan could improve is managing the balance between on-campus organizations and hall activities. Time management is a skill that is learned over time, and I am confident that Jordan has the potential to expertly manage his organizational and residence-life commitments in the future.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Jordan has the skills to work with both first-year and upperclassman students. This is because Jordan is acutely aware of many of the academic resources available to freshmen, but he has the maturity and experience it takes to work with older residents. Jordan's friendly, easygoing, yet caring, personality are a perfect fit for residents of all ages.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I believe Jordan would make a great SSM because he has demonstrated a genuine commitment to those on our hall. Not only has he forged friendships with several other residents, helping to unify our hall, but he has also made an effort to attend floor-wide and building-wide residence-life activities. These actions demonstrate that Jordan has the appreciation for community that every SSM needs.
