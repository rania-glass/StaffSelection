Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
High school counselor

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Josh for 4 years, 3 of which I was his counselor adviser while he was in high school.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
 From reading the SSM description, it seems as though an SSM will need to work with every Tech student and in a variety of ways.  Josh grew up in an area of the country in which he was fortunate enough to live around people of a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. His social circle generally aligns with the make-up of the GT student body, which has prepared him for working with all students without bias or judgment. (As background: Josh's high school is approximately 40% Hispanic, 25% black, 25% white and the remainder of students identify in other racial categories.  Additionally, half of the campus is on free reduced lunch and the other health are wealthy. ) 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Josh, at least as a high school student, was a goofy and sometimes a little bit childish.  Some of the work that resident advisors have to do is very serious.  Josh is more than capable of doing so, he may just need to be trained to handle things solemnly. (Also, many students mature quite a bit when they are on their own for the first time.)

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I do not think it would matter all that much, to be honest.  I think he would do equally well with all groups and adapt to their needs.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do because Josh is approachable and unintimidating. He really does love Georgia Tech in an authentic way, which I felt helped the resident advisors at my university do their jobs well. I also think Josh would do good at working with the adults in his role as a liaison between the university staff and students.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Josh is exceptionally intelligent and learns very, very quickly.  He will internalize any information provided to him almost immediately.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
My only rating reservation for Josh I mentioned on the previous page, and it was the issue of maturity.  I think that there is a decent chance that has already changed because there is a drastic difference between a high school student and a rising sophomore in college.  I scored it authentically and to the best of my knowledge, but it might be currently inaccurate based on natural growth and development.  Also, there is the chance that with additional responsibility he will grow as well.
