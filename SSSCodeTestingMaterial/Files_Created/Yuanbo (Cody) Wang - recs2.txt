For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've known Yuanbo (Cody) for about 4 years (3 of them when I was his International Student Adviser) at his undergraduate institution, Carleton College, and for 1 year as his supervisor when he served as peer leader mentor for our new incoming students.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Yuanbo maintained a calm demeanor as he helped new international students adjust to life in the U.S. and academic rigors of small, liberal arts college. He was reliable when we needed him, and sought out assistance when he or his mentees had questions that he didn't know the answer.  Enthusiasm for his work and the people he worked with - professional staff and fellow mentors.  Ability to work with people from across cultures.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Not sure exactly what area you are referring, but I would say knowledge of Georgia Tech's policies and procedures and depending on his placement working with graduate or older students vs first-years.  If you are asking about his potential, I believe he demonstrates great potential as an SSM as he cares for others and wants to help.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Again, the position he held was mostly working with first-years, but he also had to work with his peers so I believe he could work with upperclass students. The students he worked with were both introverts and extroverts and for the most part new to the U.S. culture and academic expectations; however he also worked with U.S. domestic students to help bridge cross-cultural understanding.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Reason mentioned above - calm, capable person who works with students from variety of cultures, domestic and international, ability to work with peers and professional staff.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Wholeheartedly recommend Yuanbo (Cody) Wang for this opportunity. No concerns that I can think of besides understanding your institution.
