PL in the Freshman Experience who is a friend of the applicant

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Jessica since my very first days at Georgia Tech, so about a year and half now. We initially became friends through a few common classes, and since then we have become very close friends.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Jessica has many strengths that would make her an excellent candidate for the SSM position.  Firstly, she is incredibly personable. The reason we became such fast friends was in part because of outgoing and kind she was to everyone she knows. This is such a valuable skill because it's not always an easy task to reach out to some residents in one's hall, but if you have this mindset and attitude, you can instill such a welcoming environment among your residents. Another strength of hers that would translate well to the SSM position would be her balance of creativity and practicality. Having known her both in the classroom and outside of the classroom, I have gotten to know that she has a great talent for coming up with innovative ideas for school-related things and personal things. As an SSM, I think she her talents in this area would flourish, as it is the perfect arena for manifesting creativity. Additionally, she exhibits a sense of practicality without compromising her creativity, which is equally important in the SSM role, especially when many deadlines are approaching and much is expected of you.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think Jessica's personality and achievements would make her a phenomenal PL or RA. In terms of developing certain areas applicable to the SSM role, I think the position would encourage her to adjust how she presents herself to difference people depending on a given situation (e.g. enforcing housing policy in tough situations, dealing with a resident struggling academically).

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Jessica would make an excellent PL or RA, but I think that she would work particularly good with Freshmen in the Freshmen Experience. As I mentioned previous, her positive, upbeat, and encouraging personality would be a great fit with a group of Freshmen who may be reluctant and shy. In conjunction with this, she therefore would be an excellent fit for people who are more generally either reserved but willing or enthusiastic and outgoing. I think the type of personality that would be harder for her to connect with would be the inward, perhaps apathetic resident.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Jessica would make an INCREDIBLE SSM. I think the enthusiasm she shows for working with people is really palpable and she is very eager to make an impact in her local community, and the SSM role would be a perfect fit for that. As I mentioned, she displays many of the qualities and characteristics that are desired of an SSM, especially a PL. I think she will be able to build a very strong community where her residents will feel welcome and wanting to participate in the hall community and the Georgia Tech community as a whole. I am extremely excited to see what she will do as an SSM if she is afforded that opportunity,
