Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
I was Cole's high school Latin teacher

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Cole since his sophomore year in high school

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Too many to enumerate! Along with his sisters, Cole is the most responsible teenager I have ever met. He was my latin club president his senior year and made my life much easier by doing everything asked of him with ease and punctuality. He never had to be reminded about anything.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Cole is one of the most 'centered' young people I have ever taught in more than thirty years. His stability, sense of responsibility and overall congeniality - aside from his brains, make him a prime candidate for this position. He was greatly liked and respected by everyone at school.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Cole worked well with everyone in high school; all ages, genders, creeds and ethnic groups. I simply cannot foresee him having trouble dealing with anyone- honest.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Cole will be outstanding at whatever he does. If I were a boss, I would hire him in a heartbeat. He will be a great, steady role model for your first-year students and a reliable ally for the other students as well.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Remarkable young man from a remarkable family. His parents did something right. You are lucky to have Cole on campus. He is- as we say ( or used to) in Latin- sui generis- one of a kind- a very good kind.
