In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant for one semester as his Peer Leader.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Blake is very good at getting others to open up to him.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Blake is not always aware of greater issues going on in peoples' lives. He is not very good at recognizing where he should tone himself down and just listen to others. Blake can do better at trusting others' opinions and not sharing his own, because that can often be destructive in relationship building and community building.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
He would work best with upperclassmen students. Blake would do well to work with someone who is more tempered and empathetic to others.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do not think Blake would make a good SSM. Though he is good at initial interactions and is very friendly, I feel like he is not always socially aware of residents' feelings and can sometimes work to invalidate them and push residents away.
