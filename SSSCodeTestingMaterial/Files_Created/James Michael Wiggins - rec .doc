In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I've known Mike for since spring 2014.  He has been a student of mine in the past and was also trusted to grade homework assignments for some of my other classes.  

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Mike is a very charismatic young man.  He makes friends easily but won't sacrifice his individuality to suit others.  He is responsible and trustworthy.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Of the qualities and responsibilities listed above, the most challenging for Mike, and probably for anyone, will be conflict resolution.  However, Mike's three sisters probably provided him with training growing up!

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I honestly can't imagine a specific student demographic that Mike wouldn't work well with.  If faced with the choice though, first- and second-year students may benefit most from his experience and outgoing personality.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Mike to be a very responsible young man.  He will excel at any task given to him simply because it is not in him to fail.  

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Mike is one of my more memorable former students.  He was one of the first students I trusted to grade homework for me and hold review sessions for my more advanced classes.  He is a wonderful young man.
