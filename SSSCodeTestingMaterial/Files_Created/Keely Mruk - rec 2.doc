Friend

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
She is my good friend and I have known her for 1 year. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Keely has an expansive knowledge base and a diverse array of interests that allow her to very easily connect with others at a deeper level. She has taken advantage of many of the campus opportunities, particularly in extracurricular organizations, so she can serve as a valuable resource to her residents. The applicant is an active listener and understands the flow of conversation well. She asks pointed questions in conversations that leads to interesting discussion. Furthermore, she has a good balance of both extroverted and introverted tendencies; for example, she thrives while interacting in groups, but is also very easy to talk to in a more reserved, one-on-one environment. Also, Keely is very creative and enjoys doing activities such as baking, crafting, making presents, etc. which make her a natural fit for the position. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I am confident in Keelyâ€™s fit for the student staff member position, and believe her to excel in the areas and skills necessary to be a peer leader. However, her constant interaction with residents and the responsibilities afforded to her by the position will develop her conversation skills, ability to work in a group setting, give her practice in administrative duties, and also will serve as an excellent vessel to express her creative side. Additionally, it would be a valuable professional experience. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Keelyâ€™s maturity and personality allow her to connect with people of all ages, backgrounds, and personalities. I believe her creativity and diverse interests will allow her to connect most with first- years in a peer leader role. Her enthusiasm and outgoing tendencies will let her forge bonds and facilitate community bonding. Most importantly, her ideas would make for excellent programs, which freshmen are far more likely to attend. Keely as a peer leader would maximize her potential as a student staff member. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
The applicant would make an incredible student staff member, an invaluable addition to any staff, and a great resource and role model for her residents. She would be able to reach out and built community through group and individual interactions, unique and innovative events, and point her residents to organizations and opportunities that they would enjoy and could take advantage of. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Keely has changed her major several times, and has insight into the process and an understanding of what freshmen might struggle with when deciding their major. I think this is a very undervalued asset, and I believe that it might be important when choosing candidates for the SSM role.
