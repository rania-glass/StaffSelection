For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I first met Murtaza at the 3 Day Startup event I hosted in 2014. He was a participant at that event. I then worked very closely with him towards organizing the 2015 event - which he lead. I served as his mentor for that event but Murtaza was responsible for pulling together the team, running the operations, fundraising, etc.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Highly personable Empathy Pioneering and self-starting Dependable and trustworthy

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
This question is very hard to answer. I'm genuinely very impressed by Murtaza. I'd recommend he work on learning to say 'no' - is eagerness may make him liable to over-commit himself. It's possible he's learned this by now.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think he'd do well with both, but would enjoy upperclassmen.  He works well with high-energy and passionate individuals. I don't know how well he would work with extremely type - A, defensive, or argumentative individuals. He's great at creating dialogue - but that means that the person he engages must be at least willing to listen. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, absolutely.  A great SSM knows to create an environment that is weloming, safe, and fun. In the 3 Day Startup event that I saw Murtaza lead, I saw how he managed to create an event that encouraged so many students to work together, share their ideas, and stay motivated.  He's great at building community and he's naturally inclined to help people. You can't go wrong with him.
