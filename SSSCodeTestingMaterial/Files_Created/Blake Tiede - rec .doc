In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Blake since the beginning of the Fall 2015 semester. He is one of my residents in my hall and I have gotten to know him well throughout the past semester.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
As an Eagle Scout, Blake shows tremendous amounts of leadership and enthusiasm. He prefers to take the lead and enjoys the role of helping others. As someone who takes initiative, he would be a great role model for residents as he often displays great study habits and a healthy social life. His enthusiastic attitude also allows him to stand out as a social, healthy student for others to follow.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Blake likes to see others grow, and he enjoys helping others. He will have to improve his ability to say no and improve his ability to be stern and official to develop as a potential SSM. He will need to acquire his 'PL voice' and understand that the job does require being the enforcer at times.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Blake would work best with first-year residents. He enjoys talking about Tech tradition and helping out others especially when it comes to new students and their experiences. Blake would work best with residents that parallel his enthusiasm, and work least well with candidates who are to themselves and are here just to get a degree.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Blake would make an excellent SSM. His enthusiasm for Tech and his leadership characteristics are phenomenal. With these characteristics and a little extra training, he would make a great academic and social mentor and a wonderful resource to residents.
