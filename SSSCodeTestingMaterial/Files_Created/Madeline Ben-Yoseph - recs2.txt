In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Maddy is my resident and I have known her for a full semester. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I believe Maddy would make a great SSM due to her charismatic attitude, her drive to be great at everything she does, and her great listening skills.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Maddy is a people person. I believe she could develop some great leadership skills from becoming an SSM. It would be a learning opportunity for both her and her residents. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I belive Maddy would be most successful with first-years as a PL. She is extremely friendly while also being committed to what she does. Maddy seems to work best with other charismatic attitudes and even connects with some of the shier people on our hall. The personality she would mesh least with would be an indifferent person who doesn't really care about what is happening. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Maddy would make a great SSM. On my hall she is one of the few people that seems to be friends with everyone and cares about everyone. She always takes the time to ask how your day was and genuinely listen.
