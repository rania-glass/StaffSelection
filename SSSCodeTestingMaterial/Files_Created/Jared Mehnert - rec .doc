In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Jared has been my resident in Towers for almost 6 months.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Jared is very action oriented. When he gets ideas that he deems are decent enough to act on, he will usually try it out. This will be very useful with creating events and working to gather community together. He is also has first-hand knowledge of unique aspects of Tech such as research and club creation.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I've noticed that some of his ideas don't get much backup from others around him. I feel he can develop his incorporation of others more into his plans and also needs to work at garnering support from other people that is just as action-oriented as he is.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Jared would be most successful with first-years. Many upperclass students are less-likely to join in on events and action when they already have their own groove. Thus I feel his style would be more impactful toward a first-year community. I believe he would work the best with those similar to him and least with the quieter, stay-at-home type of person.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I do believe that Jared would make a quality SSM. He has been very active in the community and has tried to help out in bettering the community as much as possible. You can find him not only in the dorms, but around campus and he is always willing to stop and get to know someone.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Jared has been my most active resident this year in the community. I find his ideas and contributions thus far have been unique and more interactive than the majority of input I receive.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Though he will have to develop his people skills more in order to gather more participation from those around him, I'm sure he has many qualities that will be beneficial to the SSM position and the communities he chooses to take part in.
