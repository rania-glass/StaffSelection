In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I am Emeritus's peer leader and I've known him for a little bit more than a semester.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Emeritus is an extremely friendly, outgoing, sociable, and empathetic individual. He is good at creating a lively and easy going environment. Emeritus excels at making people feel at home and he sees rewards the distinct qualities in people. With this being said, Emeritus is an extremely personable individual, you cannot help but love this guy. He sets a fantastic first impression and is great with people.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I have yet to see Emeritus act on a more serious scenario where a SSM might need to do. I believe this is because there hasn't been an ocassion where this is asked of him; for some reason there is no dull or sad moment around him, he's just that good. With this being said, I have seen him talk a fellow resident out of drinking through a few quick words on a group chat, not making me doubt for a second that if it was asked of him to make the tough calls or take on a serious attitude.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Emeritus would be most successful with first-year students. His lively mood really makes people feel comfortable and at home. I can see his personality fitting in with other Peer Leaders, where an enthusiastic attitude can really flip the frown of a homesick student. He has not only expressed his strong desires in working with freshmen students, but he also forms part of Freshman Council, leading activities for other freshman students. He will definitely be that new addition to an older staff that brings the spark they all needed. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe that Emeritus would make more than a good student staff member. He has an extremely positive attitude when it comes to literally anything. He can liven up any dull party, cheer up any concerned resident, and take your plans and make them real. He has experience in freshmen leadership and is a key part in creating the tight-nit community our side of the floor has. I have no doubt in my mind that he will be able to inspire not only retention of residents in the residence halls, but the forming of future Peer Leaders Student Staff Members.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I believe that Emeritus is a great fit in any potential freshman experience staff. He is very flexible and has developed an early desire to become a student staff member. He has a lot of drive and enthusiasm that will take him a long way.
