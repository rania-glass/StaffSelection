In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Kristina Beck since Spring 2015 in two capacities – first as a member of the Georgia Tech Dance Association (GTDA) and second as an employee of the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI).  Kristina started working at GTRI in Summer 2015 and that is when I really began to know her in a professional setting.  I am the faculty advisor of GTDA and am a Research Engineer II with GTRI.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Kristina is one of the most approachable people I know and is an excellent student researcher.  She is extremely personable and is a joy to work with.  Kristina is a role model to the other students in our lab and is punctual, efficient, and shows high technical aptitude.  She works very well on our team-based projects and is a reliable and valuable asset to our lab.  From the GTDA side, she is our current secretary for the 2015-2016 season and she takes meticulous notes at all meetings, provides valuable input at board meetings and is always willing to dance with someone new.  As the faculty advisor for the club, I keep an eye on potential students that I want to be the next President of the club.  If Kristina choses to run for that position, I would have no doubt that she would fill that role perfectly and I would not have to worry about anything going wrong with her in that position.  Kristina is a natural leader and is well organized as observed both in her role as a student researcher at GTRI and as an officer and member of GTDA.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Based on my understandings of what is needed as an SSM, I do not see anything that Kristina needs to work on for her to be an SSM.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Kristina would work well with any set of students.  She would most likely fit a good big-sister role and so I would recommend her work with first-years due to her personality and demeanor.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, she would be an excellent SSM.  As previously stated, she has excellent strengths that compliment her including her personality and demeanor.

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
I believe Kristina is excellent in all the categories I marked above - and if there were ones I would highlight above and beyond, they would be Maturity, Integrity, and Leadership Potential.  I marked Not Applicable to Diversity & Social Justice Awareness because I simply have never asked her about that topic.  I would imagine she is informed on the issues that are present in the world today -- but have never discussed this with her and thus marked N A.
