In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I met Johnny when he was accepted onto the Freshman Activities Board at the beginning of the year. I work as his Sophmore Advisor specializing in Internal Relations and Individual Student Growth, so I have gotten many opportunities to work with Johnny in a teamwork-oriented leadership setting.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Johnny is creative, enthusiastic, friendly, and incredibly teamwork-oriented. He is always the first to volunteer to help and can find a way to befriend anyone he meets. He has an amazing ability to come up with new, refreshing ideas, find the best way to execute them, make sure they are all-inclusive, and make everything a roaring success. Any event he has been able to help with has been exponentially improved by his critical thinking and teamwork skills.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I believe the experience of working in smaller teams or even by himself will be beneficial to Johnny. He's incredible in a big group, but he hasn't had as many opportunities to work with only one or two other people. While I believe he'll still be good at it, I think it's a useful skill to develop early in college.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Johnny's enthusiasm and love for Georgia Tech will make him be a great first impression for first-year students. He'll feed off their excitement to be at college and funnel it right back into them. He'll be the first to recommend organizations on campus or resource available that fit each resident's personality. The only problem he'll have is with apathetic students who do not want to do anything, but I think his infectious personality will eventually get to even the worst of them.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Johnny would be an amazing SSM. If I had a role model like Johnny my first-year, I believe I would have found my love for Georgia Tech earlier. I believe we need more positive, uplifting people in leadership positions on campus, and Johnny is a prime example of just that.
