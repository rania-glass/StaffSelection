N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have supervised Kyle in his role as Resident Advisor at Emory University. I have known Kyle for about six months. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Kyle embodies and exceeds every responsibility mentioned above. Kyle has demonstrated a strong ability with developing interpersonal skills among his residents. He has continuously sought to create a welcoming and conducive environment on his hall. I can attest to Kyle's greatest strength being in the area of programming and his hard work ethic, as demonstrated by his role as president of the Residence Hall Association. Kyle is the first to volunteer for any tasks I have during staff meetings and the last to leave events to help with cleaning. Kyle has done all of this while simultaneously balancing a rigorous academic course load and leading two other organizations, including two that he founded: the German Culture Club and the Emory Engineering Society. Kyle was the first Resident Advisor to receive the Coke Legend Award from me, a small token of recognition for being a role model among the staff. Kyle is passionate and enthusiastic about Emory, showcased with his role as a campus tour guide. He brings that wealth of knowledge to his hall to connect first year students to Emory. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
The biggest area of development for Kyle as a potential SSM is learning about the Georgia Tech culture and community. This would be Kyle's first year on campus (by default because of his desire to pursue a Master's degree) and the first time working with a different population of students. While I have no doubt that Kyle will adjust and be a beacon of light on the staff, it will still take some time for him to adjust to the shift. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Kyle has the most experience working with first year students but I think the nature of his standing as a graduate student will position him to work with graduate residents. I think that Kyle will excel with graduate students because he will bring the experience of working within a university that strongly emphasizes community building and connections within the first year experience. While the demographics of the residents will be different, Kyle will bring his experience and creativity to connect graduate students that may not otherwise care for the traditional community building activities. I know that Kyle will have a servant-leadership style that will assist in catering to the unique needs of graduate students. Kyle works extremely well with peers that have a passion for their position. I think he works least well with those that have a lackadaisical attitude. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely.  After working with Resident Advisors in multiple capacities over the past five years, Kyle is definitely what I imagine when I think of a great RA. He has a passion for the position and a willingness to learn. He will develop a strong relationship with his supervisor and adapt to their needs and expectations. I think Kyle's experience working in a multitude of positions within Residence Life at Emory will set him up for success at Georgia Tech.
