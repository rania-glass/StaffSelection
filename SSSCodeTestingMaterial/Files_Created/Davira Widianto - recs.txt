In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Two semesters

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Davira (Tia) is an incredibly driven individual; if she puts her mind to something, she not only does it but does it well. She's very approachable and has a very mature mindset that would make her a great SSM. While she's very focused and meticulous in her decisions and actions, she also  has a personality that makes you feel welcomed and respected. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
From what I know, I do not see Tia being very active in the Tech community beyond attending housing events and research. That being said, I could see her development in getting to know Tech more and relaying that knowledge to her residents. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Tia would work well with upperclassmen students because she is stronger in that one-on-one bond instead of trying to get freshmen excited about going to school. Because she's more reserved, she would work well with someone who is a bit more outgoing but not overpowering. On the flip side, she would work least well with someone who has no passion whatsoever. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Tia would be a great SSM. She is very understanding and patient, which I find very critical in SSM's. On the same note, she's very devoted in everything that she does so she would be very determined in enhancing the living learning community for her residents. While she has contributions as an SSM, I know that she could also gain a lot from the position and get to know more different types of people, too. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Tia is incredibly motivated and in general, probably one of the most successful people I've met at Tech not because her involvement in organizations, grades, or social skills (all qualities that most people think of when they think 'success'), but because of how she knows what she wants and knows how to get what she wants. This in itself is success to me and I know that her residents could definitely benefit from her as a guiding figure.
