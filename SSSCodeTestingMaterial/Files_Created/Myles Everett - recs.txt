In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Myles since the summer of 2011. We were both members of the OMED Challenge program. Also, in Summer 2014 we were both Counselors in the Challenge Program

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Myles is a very charismatic guy and is always trying to make other people's experience the best that they can be. He is able to relate with people from varying backgrounds and is very mature and knowledgeable in Georgia Tech customs and standards. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Through prior work experience, Myles has demonstrated that he has all of the necessary skills and qualifications to be an SSM. Becoming more familiar with the specific duties of a Georgia Tech SSM would be the only area of development. However, I believe he would quickly learn such duties and execute them extremely well. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Myles would be better suited to interact with upperclass students.   He works well with enthusiastic and charismatic people, like himself, and would not work well with pessimistic personalities.  

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I think Myles would be a great SSM. Not only does he have the personality and maturity for the job, but he also has similar prior work experience. By being a OMED Challenge Program Counselor, Myles was essential a summer SSM. He had to carry out administrative tasks and interact with residents while maintaining a mature and enthusiastic candor.
