I am an employee of the campus ministry where the applicant frequents.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I would describe my relationship with Ian as a mentor mentee relationship. I have known him since August, just before the semester started.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ian has a very approachable demeanor, which I think is very valuable in the type position he is applying for. He is also very understanding and caring. At the same time, he knows when to be blunt, and will not be afraid to say what needs to be said.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Ian could improve in initiating conversations with strangers. He's doing well, but he can get better.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think he can work really well with freshmen. He's exciting and fun. Potentially not as well with upperclassmen. It could be harder for him to earn their respect since he is younger.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. I think Ian would be great. He loves people and genuinely cares about their well being.
