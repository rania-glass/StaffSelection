N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Tristan since August.  He is one of my residents as well as the Social Chair for our community's Hall Council.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
He is extremely charismatic, personable, and friendly.  As Social Chair, he is always looking for events that will help bring our community closer together, and everyone is always interested to hear what kind of event he has planned next.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
For the SSM role, he already has have all of the necessary attributes to not only satisfy but also exceed the tasks of the position.  An area of development I could see for him would be for him to take greater initiative in helping a community reach its full potential.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I can see Tristan as a Peer Leader more than anything else.  Freshmen would be much more appreciative of his energy and outgoing attitude, and he would make their first year one to remember.  He works best with anyone who is willing to step out of their comfort zone to try something new, but he would probably face his greatest struggles with residents who actively isolate themselves from the rest of the community.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I think Tristan would be an amazing SSM.  He already has many years under his belt as a camp counselor, which is the sort of the position that translates seamlessly into the role of an SSM; he has worked with other counselors to plan events for the campers to enjoy and help them develop a sense of community among one another in a very brief time (often only a week).

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
Of the freshmen that I have met this year, Tristan is arguably the most suitable applicant for the SSM position.  It sometimes feels as though there is a third PL on our floor.
