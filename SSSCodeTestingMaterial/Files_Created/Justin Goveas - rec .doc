In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I am very pleased to be writing this recommendation letter on behalf of Justin Goveas.   I was Justinâ€™s Teen P.E.P. (a Prevention Education Program) teacher during his senior year in high school.  However, I have known him since his junior year.  I want to provide you with a short overview of the course so that you can understand the importance of his role in the Teen PEP program.    Senior Teen PEP (Prevention Education Program) is a group of students who are in their second year of the Teen PEP program, a program which requires application, recommendations, an interview, and acceptance.  Teen PEP students are trained in sexuality issues, such as postponing sexual involvement, pregnancy prevention, sexual harassment, homophobia reduction, STIs and HIV AIDS.  Additionally, they are trained in leadership and facilitation skills.  With the knowledge and skills gained from the course, Teen PEP students facilitate outreach workshops to the 9th graders and Middle School students in the district on sexuality related issues.     As I mentioned, Justin was my student during his senior year, which was Year 2 of the program. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
As Justin's Teen PEP teacher and advisor, I was able to observe Justin apply his skills and strengths in our workshops.  He would perform skits on stage to the underclassman.  He was a strong performer because he was confident, charismatic, and consistently prepared with his lines memorized.  After skits, he and a partner would facilitate small group activities with groups of 10-15 students, guiding them through activities and discussions that related to the workshop topic (which were all related to sexuality issues).  He articulated his insights clearly, he spoke with confidence, he collaborated with his facilitation partner with ease, he was knowledgeable in the content (because he is a very bright young man), and he was very, very likable and personable.  He had great enthusiasm and energy that would motivate even the sleepiest of the block one freshmen!    Additionally, I have observed Justin work with his Teen PEP peers (aka 'colleagues'), developing great friendships with people of all backgrounds (the class is very diverse).  He is open and accepting of so many different people.    Furthermore, he is well-traveled, and he is globally aware.  There is not doubt in my mind that the strengths I observed in him as a high school senior in my program, have expanded, now that he is in college, older and wiser.  He has an extremely strong foundation of skills, and he would make an excellent SSM.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Justin is very ambitious and very social.  He has high standards and strives to achieve in all areas of his life.  In high school, he was able to manage a variety of activities, as well as perform well academically.  He was a friendly, well-liked person and enjoyed interacting with others.  He put time into getting to know people, and really enjoyed understanding people's 'stories.'  While it may sound cliche, my only real concern is that Justin would spread himself thin, wanting to be a part of so many college experiences while performing well academically.  I do believe he could learn additional strategies to improve his 'school-work-life balance,' to add to what he has already demonstrated in the past.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Justin would do well with first years.  He is honest and straight-forward in his communication.  If this placement is for next year, which would be his sophomore year, then I think working with freshmen, he would really 'tell it like it is.'  His honesty would help next year's freshmen to see the harsh reality of their decision-making.  He would candidly remind students the potential consequences of their actions.    I do not feel I can honestly answer the second part of the question.  In the setting in which I worked with Justin, he collaborated well with many different types of people.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I've identified many strengths in Justin's character already.  To summarize, he is outgoing, personable, knowledgeable, and confident.  If he becomes an RA, for example, I could see him mentoring underclassmen as they work through college decision-making.  He is a good mentor because he communicates well, and he views situations from multiple perspectives.  He is also very honest, and if someone is making potentially dangerous choices, I am confident Justin would speak up to address an issue, help to educate a student who needs some guidance, and  provide support as they navigate their choices and the consequences of his her actions.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I fully recommend Justin and support him in this endeavor....he would be awesome in the role!
