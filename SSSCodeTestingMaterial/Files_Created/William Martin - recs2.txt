In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
He has been my resident since August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
It would be difficult to name them all here! Firstly, he is a strong student with a good work ethic. He is both socially diverse and socially adaptable. He is a prominent follower of open door policy and often has others visit, but he also makes sure to visit people both through the hall and in other dorms. He is friendly and capable of discussing sensitive topics. I have never known him not to be welcoming and takes part in hall area wide events. For a short list: Friendly, inviting, socially experienced, very professional, respecting, caring, capable of problem solving, and fun.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I have not seen much of his leadership skills, so it's possible that they are lacking. However, he has not been in many instances where he had to use them yet as a freshman, so I think if he was placed in a leadership position he would easily be able to perform.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Both first years and upperclassmen would work. He is capable of connecting with all types of personalities, but he is slightly introverted, so unless he really tried to connect with someone else who was introverted it is possible that he may not get to know them that well even if they are compatible. He may not work well with people that have respect issues though, because he is not very firm, but it is difficult not to respect how kind, polite, and fun he is.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely. I think any staff would be lucky to have him. He both very reliable and very enjoyable. I can see him being very successful on any hall.
