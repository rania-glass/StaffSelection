In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Neel for 6 years now. We went to magnet school together at Wheeler HS and have spent the past year and a half Together here at Georgia Tech. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Neel is the type of person that can make any person feel like his best friend. He is extremely personable, and somehow manages to keep in touch with all of his middle school and high school friends, while also making several new ones at Tech. Neel has also been involved on campus through being a referee at the CRC, and is always informing me of other fun events on campus. I think he would be an incredible resource for freshman who want to find where they fit and can get involved at Tech. He has is a go-to person for me and all of our other friends. His future residents will be lucky to have him.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Neel trusts people. This is so much so that he may not immediately realize it if a resident is not being truthful to him. However, I think that once he becomes acclimated to the position and with training, this will not be a problem, and he will be more mindful.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think Neel would work the best with first-years because he is very easy to talk to, and I think he could really help them get acclimated and flourish at Tech. He would maybe work the least well with upper classmen, only because they tend to do their own thing, and he might have a more difficult time organizing events everyone could come to.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, Neel has all of the qualities that I think a good SSM needs. He is friendly, responsible, and an amazing friend to everyone. Unlike many, he has his stuff together. He can build relationships easily. While being approachable, he can also put his foot down when necessary. He has always been one to help steer me in the right direction, and I know he could take those inherent qualities and do well as an SSM.
