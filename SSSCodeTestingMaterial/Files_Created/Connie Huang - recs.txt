In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Connie since the beginning of the 2015 Fall Semester. Connie is the Social Chair of our Hall Council, and I often work with her to help plan and organize events.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Connie's strengths include her observant nature and her ability to organize. She is able to work well with others and understand both their words and body language well. This often allows her to effectively gauge situations and make appropriate decisions. Her organization also contributes to her effectiveness, especially in the role of a Hall Council officer. Her organization skills prevent over-scheduling and miscommunication. She is better able to help not only herself succeed, but others. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Connie tends to be shy. She prefers to stay in her comfort zone and normal routine. As a potential SSM, Connie will need to learn how to come out of her shell more and take the initiative to start conversations and activities. Residents will look to her to make the first move and begin to converse. This is often something that she does not do. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Connie would work best with first-year students. Her desire and want to help those around her and act as a mentor will allow her to succeed mostly with first-years as they will also want someone to look up to. She would probably work best with residents that are more conscious about their academic life, especially those that are a little more reserved. I find she would initially struggle with residents who focus on their extracurricular and social life, but eventually form a strong connection with these same residents.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Connie would make an excellent SSM. Her personality is growth oriented and she is not afraid to fail. As an SSM she would act as an excellent resource to new and old students alike, as she already knows most, if not more, of the resources we guide residents to today. Her passion to be a mentor and make a positive impact on students has lead her to be one of the most oriented and driven first-years I know. This shows in both her academic and extracurricular life. I honestly believe she has the potential and will to do anything she puts her mind to.
