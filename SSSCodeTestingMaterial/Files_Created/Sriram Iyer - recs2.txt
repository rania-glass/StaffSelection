In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Sriram since the beginning of this academic year, when he was accepted onto the Freshman Activities Board. I have worked loosely with him as the internal and member relations advisor. I am in charge of knowing the members and helping them grow individually.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Sriram is one of the most approachable people I know. He cares extremely for others and is always more than willing to go above and beyond when it comes to either leading or assisting others. He's incredibly funny and knows exactly how to make others feel comfortable around him.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I believe Sriram would benefit most from the behind-the-scenes organizational and professional aspects of being a SSM. While I've definitely seen these areas approve in the past months, it'll be helpful for him to apply and learn skills in this area to something he is truly passionate about.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I feel his inviting, caring attitude would work best with first-year students or possibly underclassmen. He works best with enthusiastic personalities, and when those are not present, he tries his best to make the unenthusiastic participants more excited about whatever task is at hand. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
When I was a freshman, my PL was not very enthusiastic and never seemed to venture out of his comfort level. Had he been a role model for me, I would not have gotten nearly as far as I have today. That's not the case with Sriram. Sriram is going to take each individual resident and find ways to make them excited about Tech. I could see great leaders coming from Sriram's hall simply because he is going to make students excited to be at Tech and ignite a passion for making it better.
