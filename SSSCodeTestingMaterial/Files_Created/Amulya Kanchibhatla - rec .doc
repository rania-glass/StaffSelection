For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Current Director of Organization she is in.

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Amy since the beginning of Fall 2015. I supervise her in FSLO. I have met with her several times to talk about her involvement in past organizations and her passions. Within the club, I can always rely on her word and she has excellent ideas that she contributes regularly. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Amy is very good at problem-solving. I have sought her advice several times when I am wondering how to make FSLO more effective and she has great ideas. She is also open to listening to others' ideas when it comes to planning events. Amy takes initiative. At our first event she quickly volunteered for the job of selling donuts and learned how to use the Buzzcard reader quickly and approached people with kindness and enthusiasm. She is committed to service as she always arrives on time to meetings and plays an active role even when others in the organization do not. She is responsible. Within FSLO she holds a leadership position and the other members elected her because they knew she was dependable and reliable. Sum it up, Amy is a great leader, quick-learner, approachable, enthusiastic, dependable, and a great problem-solver. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Amy gives 100% in all she does, however, she may spread herself to thin sometimes. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I have seen Amy work with her freshmen peers very well. Amy is mature and would be great with upperclass men too. I think she would be most beneficial with freshmen because she is approachable, responsible, caring, smart, yet not overbearing. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Amy would be an excellent SSM, there is no doubt in my mind. She is a true servant leader and I know she is very passionate about leading as an SSM. When Amy is passionate about something, she makes sure to make it successful to the best of her ability and she is very able. She is experienced and I think if you did not pick her for this position you would be missing out on a PL or RA who would make a positive impact on her residents by helping them in whatever way she could.
