In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have been friends & in other organizations with this applicant since Spring 2014.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
This applicant has strong communication, listening, and logistical skills. He has planned multiple large scale events and is very dedicated to doing a great job. He is very dedicated to getting to know the people around him and I have no doubt he would put these skills to use well within the SSM position.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think that an area that this SSM could develop in is being formally exposed to different communication skills and different confrontational situations. Although he has a strong base in both of these subjects, I think he could become even better in them in the future.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I think that this applicant would be a fantastic SSM no matter what population he was with, although I believe him to be a perfect fit to be a Peer Leader and work with the Freshmen Experience Program.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. I believe that he has a strong foundation in all of the skills required within the SSM position. More importantly I think that he has a strong desire to be in the position and the passion to want to connect to his residents and help them in any way that he can. I think the mix of these two skills make him a prime candidate for an SSM position

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
He has a very charming personality and is always flexible to make sure that everything is going well with what he is working on. I think that along with being a great mentor on a floor of Peer Leaders, he would be an amazing person for any staff to work with.
