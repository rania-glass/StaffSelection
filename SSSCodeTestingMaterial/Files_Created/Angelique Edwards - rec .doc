In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Angel has been my resident since August 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Angel has various strengths that make her an excellent candidate for the SSM role. First, Angel has an advanced understanding of the resources and organizations on campus. She is extremely involved and is part of Freshman Council, the African American Student Union, and SGA. She spends her extracurricular time serving Tech students in these leadership roles, and her extensive knowledge of campus will allow her to effectively connect residents to organizations they are interested in and resources that they can utilize.  In addition to her knowledge of the Georgia Tech community, Angel is also extremely approachable and kind. I find it very easy to talk to Angel because it is clear she genuinely cares about her peers. Other members of Angel’s staff would find it easy and enjoyable to work with her because she has charisma and has experience working with others on projects and in organizations.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Because Angel is so involved on campus, she does not spend long periods of time in the residence hall at a time. However, the time she spends is meaningful because she interacts with other residents in the hall, takes the time to talk to me about her day, attends hall programs, and is not afraid to ask me questions. Angel would need to work on being available and accessible to residents, but I think her wonderful time management skills and genuine passion will help her make her role as an SSM a priority.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Angel could work with first-year students or with upperclassmen, but she would be more successful working with first-year students. Angel is extremely knowledgeable about Freshman Leadership Organizations and other leadership opportunities for first-year students on campus, and she would help her residents adapt to college life.  Angel can work with a wide variety of personality types. She is confident and likes to take action so she would balance well with idea-oriented individuals. Soft-spoken individuals may find it difficult to work with Angel at first, but they would quickly realize that Angel is a very genuine, caring person and would eventually find it easy to open up to her.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Angel would be an extremely successful SSM on any staff. She would collaborate with the members of her staff, she would respect her Hall Director and would not be afraid to ask questions, and she has the determination and enthusiasm to adjust her schedule to make the SSM position one of her top priorities.
