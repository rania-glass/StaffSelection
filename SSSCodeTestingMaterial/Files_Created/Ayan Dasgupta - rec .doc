In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Since the Fall of 2015 as a fellow member of the Greek community fraternity. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
This applicant is representative of an well-balanced individual that emphasizes the importance of leadership, fairness, and understanding. In terms of leadership,   Ayan has taken initiative by reaching above and beyond what is needed. By doing so, he has made a very powerful impression on those around him by motivating them. He has the unique capability of  analyzing his environment and coming to decisions that may not be the most 'popular', but are the most needed and appropriate. Lastly, he has been recognized as an individual who can understand a situation in a way that highlights his maturity. He is the type of person to know exactly what to do when an unexpected conundrum may arise. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Areas of development would revolve mainly around experience. Although Ayan has all the necessary components to be a great SSM, he would need a platform to demonstrate and master his skills in the correct setting.  I believe this area of development is frequent in a student such as Ayan that are relatively new to the college environment.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe his interactions would be most successful with mostly first-years. Because of his age, he can be seen more as a guide and a mentor than as an older 'authoritative' figure. His personality, as mentioned in a previous question, would allow for flexibility in the full spectrum of other personalities ranging from introverted to extroverted. Because of his ability to be understanding, it allows adaptability in the type of other personalities he'd mingle well with.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I wholeheartedly believe that Ayan is the right match to be a stellar SSM. From his prior experience in extracurriculars in high school to his current experience in college, he has made a positive impact in our fraternity and is known to be a do-er that takes action.
