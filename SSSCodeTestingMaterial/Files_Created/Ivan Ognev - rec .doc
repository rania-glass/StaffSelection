N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Ivan was in my English class during Fall semester 2015.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ivan is specific, detailed, hardworking. He's whipsmart and is able to bring a sense of gravity and responsibility into the collaborative environment, as well as a sense of humor.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Mediating interpersonal conflict, organizing events

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Upperclass students. Ivan is very smart--I think he has limited patience for students who are not focused. I think he'd do very well with students who had already made it through the weedout period and proven themselves dedicated to meeting the demands of Georgia Tech.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes. He has a strong sense of direction and purpose. I think you can count on Ivan to act as a leader among his peers without losing his ability to work alongside them.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
You'd be fortunate to have Ivan working with you.
