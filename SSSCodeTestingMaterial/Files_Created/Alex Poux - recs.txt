Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Director of the GT Honors Program (Alex is a member of the Honors Program).

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Alex since fall 0f 2014, his freshman year.  I first became acquainted with Alex when he reached out to me (in his first semester at GT) with (great!) suggestions for the Honors Program and a request for a meeting with me to discuss.  I later recruited Alex to serve in our first cohort of  Honors Program Triple Leaders to lead & mentor a group of  freshmen Honors Program students in the 2015-16 entering class. I have also met with Alex on several occasions since fall 2014 to brainstorm strategize ideas for the Honors Program.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Alex is a deeply nice and kind person who cares about others and respects them in all their diversity.  He is a sincere person--no hidden agendas or phony friendliness. He has a lively, imaginative, creative, problem-solving mind and temperament. He is endlessly energetic, can-do, and upbeat. He is a natural leader of the best kind--people respect and follow him because he radiates optimism, enthusiasm, friendliness, and support & respect for others. He is quick on his feet and very good in a crunch (when we hit snags in our Honors Program Retreat in fall 2015, Alex was one of the Triple Leaders who stepped up, analyzed the problems & potential solutions, and executed the solutions with skill and no drama).

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I haven't encountered shortcomings in Alex. If I were to guess at the chief challenge for any person with Alex's energy and enthusiasm level it would be working with those who are less so. My hunch is that Alex is one of the energetic enthusiastic types of people who also has so much compassion, kindness, and respect for others by his nature, that he would actually be good at understanding and supporting  those who are different from him.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
As suggested in my answer to question 10,  I have not seen any shortcomings in Alex that would suggest a problem connecting with all kinds of first-years. I suspect he would relate immediately to people like him and, due to his warm and friendly temperament & character, with all others as well.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I believe Alex would make an excellent SSM! In addition to all the strengths detailed above (Question 10), Alex would be someone that housing residence life could always rely on--both to generate the positive energy that makes for a great Tech experience for our students, and to come through in a crunch when difficulties arise (his maturity & personal responsibility quotients, in my observation, are very high).

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
In addition to all of the above, Alex is a great and fun person to know and work with!

Any other comments or concerns regarding this applicant?
As mentioned above, I  recruited Alex to serve as an Honors Program Triple Leader after getting to know him (as a result of his reaching out to me to offer suggestions for the Honors Program when he was a 1st-semester freshman). I recall standing next to Alex by a bus filled with first-year Honors Program students we were conveying to their Retreat venue. This was after we had to improvise to solve  a problem that had arisen, and Alex's input and operationalization were key to the solution. I spontaneously said to him something like, 'I am so glad I recruited you, Alex, thank you!' He smiled in a warm, modest, appreciative way, and said something like 'Of course, I'm so happy to do this.' Alex is a person I would always want on my team.
