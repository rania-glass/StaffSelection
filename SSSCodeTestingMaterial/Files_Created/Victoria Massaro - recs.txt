In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant for about five months as a friend.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Victoria is spirited, responsible, and creative. She is an active participant in everything we have experienced together and her positive attitude is exceptionally admirable.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Victoria's areas of development will probably start with her ability to handle the darker duty situations that are replicated through BCDs. I feel she is currently is more of a talker than a listener but I am 100% confident that fall training will give her the tools she needs to be an effective and outstanding PL.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
She would work well with first-years. She is great at being helpful - whether it be with advice from personal experience or from her knowledge of the subject at hand. She also has a ton of energy and patience which is a crucial part of being a PL.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I honestly believe Victoria would be a great SSM. She makes an effort to know everyone around her and she gets along with everyone and anyone. She would not only be a great leader for her residents, but a great leader within her staff.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Victoria has a great heart. She is involved with a program called HRW Music Group, who takes children from low income areas who show musical talent and send their recordings to record labels. She also volunteers at Christ the Kind church during the winter to make care bags for the homeless. She is an exceptional and selfless person and I am lucky to know her.
