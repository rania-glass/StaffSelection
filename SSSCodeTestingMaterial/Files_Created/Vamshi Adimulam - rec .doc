Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Advisor and mentor to him when he served as a local and state officer for Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA)

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Vamshi for 3 years and served as his advisor and mentor while he was a local chapter officer for Monroe-Woodbury FBLA and NYS FBLA (Future Business Leaders of America)

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Vamshi has significant leadership experience from his time serving as a local and state officer in FBLA and other leadership positions in other organizations he was involved with in high school.  As NYS FBLA's Executive Vice President, Vamshi supervised 7 state vice presidents in their duties which included training them on their roles as SVP's, assisting them with developing their district meetings, providing encouragement and support in stressful situations, and evaluating their work 3 times during the school year.   He's a good listener and communicator and has an extremely strong work ethic.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I think, in general, he's a very mature young man, but there are times when he can get overly critical of certain situations and when that happens he tends to get tunnel-vision.  He needs to work on being more open-minded when those types of situations occur.    Overall, though I think he is very well-rounded with his skill-set.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
 Vamshi  has a strong academic, co-curricular and sports background, so  he would work well with most types of residents.  He does tend to gravitate to people who are hard-workers and who want to be involved, rather than those that just want to sit on the sidelines.  He tends to be critical of those that say they will do something and then don't do it, unless there is a mitigating circumstance.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, I do.  As a local and state officer, Vamshi mentored many of his fellow FBLA members - encouraging them to participate in school and civic events, helping find the right competition to suit their specific strengths, and when someone was having a difficult time, whether in school, personally, et.c., he would offer a shoulder to lean on.  He led by example, participating in as many activities and competitions as he could while understanding his own personal limitations.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Vamshi was well-respected as a local and state officer in FBLA.  Members and adult leadership often sought out his thoughts and opinions on issues, activities, etc..  He's very much a gentleman, polite and helpful with a strong sense of right and wrong.
