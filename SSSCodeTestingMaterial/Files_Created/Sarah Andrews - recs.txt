Cheerleading Coach

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have had the pleasure of coaching Sarah Andrews in her capacity as a student athlete since May 2015. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Sarah exhibits the leadership skills necessary to build her team up at practice and on the field court. At appearances outside of these functions, she is very patient, kind, and professionals with the fan base and children she interacts with. I would only expect these qualities to translate into her role as a SSM. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
I believe that being a SSM would development Sarah's ability to work with a diverse group of individuals. Being a student athlete means that you spend a lot of time with your teammates. Having the opportunity to work with different groups on campus and individuals from all different backgrounds will only strengthen her leadership qualities mentioned above. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
While I have no doubt Sarah would be a good fit for any age group, I believe Sarah would work best with first-years over other age groups. I believe this because she exhibits a lot of patience when interacting with our fan base, particularly children. She is also very understanding, and I believe she would set a great example for new students entering the college world. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely. The summary above about what it means to be a SSM encompasses a lot of the qualities we ask of our cheerleaders. We chose Sarah to be a part of our program because we believe she exhibits all of these qualities. 

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
I would like to add that Sarah is from Florida, which means her family is far away. Her teammates have been paramount in her experience at Tech by making her feel like she has a family at school. I know being a SSM will increase these feelings for her and will in turn enhance her experience at Georgia Tech.
