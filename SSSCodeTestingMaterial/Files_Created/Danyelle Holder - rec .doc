In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Danyelle is one of my residents.  I have known her since the beginning of fall semester 2015.  I have gotten to know Danyelle through conversations with her and her friends on the hall.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Danyelle is friendly and easy to get along with.  She is a very positive person.  In fact, I do not think I have seen her without a smile on her face.  I believe that her positive attitude would inspire residents, and that she would easily be able to develop strong relationships with her residents and staff.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Although Danyelle's quiet personality makes her very approachable, and would lend itself to meaningful one-on-one interactions with residents,  she would have to learn to bring more energy to hall events and programs.  However I believe that she would be able to learn to be more outgoing when necessary.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Danyelle would get along with all types of residents, however I believe that her approachability would make her an excellent Peer Leader.  Because Danyelle is more soft-spoken, I believe that she would work best with quieter personalities.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Danyelle's positive attitude and friendly personality make her well-suited for the SSM position.  While talking about her involvement in her high school's yearbook staff, I noticed that she really values collaboration, which I believe is paramount to success as an SSM.  She would be able to work well with her residents and staff.
