In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I was the appliicants RA over the summer for four months.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
The applicant is incredibly mature, well-spoken, and is great at collaborating with others. He would be able to mediate conflicts greatly, and is a very approachable and informed person.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
The applicant is incredibly great at working with others, but I'm not sure if he has planned fully social events before. However, I am sure he would get the hang of it.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Upperclassman, because the student is very mature, calm, and respectable and would most likely be better working with upperclass students and helping them, as opposed to planning events for overenthusiastic first years.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes, due to his great personality, sense of humor, and maturity, I feel the candidate would be a great PL and be very capable of managing conflicts.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
My floor was difficult during the summer semester since I RA'd for conference services which he worked for, but he also made my events and meetings very seamless.
