N A

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
Ashal is a resident of mine who has been very involved in hall activities. He is energetic and instigated cohesion among the floor. He has really made my job easier and is really pleasant to be around. I have known him since he arrived at Georgia Tech this school year. 

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Ashal is FULL of energy. He lights up anytime I see him on the hall and can be heard from anywhere on the hall - in a good way. He has a good since of right and wrong and is very responsible. Ashal is absolutely approachable and even though he is energetic, he is a great listener. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Ashal would need to gain the knowledge that fall training gives SSMs. Particularly how to handle duty situations and how to resolve conflicts. He may also benefit from learning campus resources. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Ashal's energy level would suit a first-year residence hall. I have not seen him work negatively with anyone. He has many friends and seems to get along great with them. They are from different states backgrounds ethnicities. 

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
From the moment I met Ashal, I thought he had the energy that I think makes a great PL. While it's important to be able to handle a crisis, it is also important to bring life to the hall and I believe Ashal has what it takes to provide a exceptional residential experience.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Don't pass up Ashal. I think there are several people that get this job that don't exemplify the spirit I see in him.
