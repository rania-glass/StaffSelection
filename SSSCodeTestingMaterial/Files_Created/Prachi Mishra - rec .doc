In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known Prachi for 5 months now. She served as one of the team leaders in my GT1000 class in the Fall of 2015. She is also a student assistant in our office.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Prachi's strengths are by far her positive attitude, her enthusiasm, and her organizational skills. She was one of the most prepared TLs I have worked with after teaching the course two semesters. She came to weekly meetings with ideas, was always willing to work with the students outside of class, and just served as a great role model in and outside of the class. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
One area of improvement for Prachi could be knowing when to step back and let others lead. Working with a group of other strong leaders will give her the opportunity to feel comfortable stepping back and taking on a different role in groups. 

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
I believe that Prachi would be successful at connecting with any resident and working with all types of personalities. I have only interacted with her when working with first-year students and can say that she is definitely a good role model. She listens very well, provides her opinion when need be, and is just overall pleasant to be around.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Prachi will make a great member of your team. I believe that she has a lot to contribute, is dedicated to whatever she commits to, and will set a great example for her peers and residents that she works with,.
