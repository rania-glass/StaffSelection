Your Relationship to the Applicant
Other (please specify in next question)

For the previous question, if you selected 'Other' please specify here. Â If not, please type 'N A'.
Friend, and his physics teacher

In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
3 years as a student in my classes and on the basketball court.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
Nico genuinely cares about everyone that he knows.  He is kind, thoughtful and willing to sacrifice for the common good.  He will see potential issues long before the are real problems and find solutions that empower the students on the floor.  

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
None, he will be great and will get better with experience.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
While I think that he would be successful with any age group, I think that mostly first-years would get the most from his caring nature and patient good humor.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
I have no doubts that he will be a fantastic SSM.  I have seen Nico do the following: sing a beautiful solo at a music performance; help a student in the hall that he didnâ€™t know that well but who needed a kind word; get a perfect score on a very difficult HL Physics test; stand in front of the whole school and give an inspirational introduction to an activity; and I have seen him jump up and down in sincere enthusiasm after seeing his friend make a fairly good play in volleyball. There is not just one thing that sets him apart, it is the sum of all the great things that he does as well as his kind nature as he does so.  As a parent, I would love to know that Nico was a SSM for either of my boys.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Nico is  a fantastic person.  Our school is a significantly better place because Nico went here. He brings a kindness and positive energy to everything that he is involved in. As the girlsâ€™ basketball coach, I was able to travel on several trips with Nico to other countries for weeklong competitions as he played for the boysâ€™ team. It was his junior year and he didnâ€™t always start back then, but he still brought a positive energy that helped everyone on the team. I remember after a particular painful loss, it was Nico who said some things to help everyone gain perspective and remember what really mattered. While he does that sort of thing all the time as our student body president, I was impressed with his composure in a really tough time.
