In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known the applicant since August 2015. She became involved in the GT organization I work for, Christian Campus Fellowship, and we began meeting on a weekly basis at events and smaller group settings. I know her fairly well.

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
I am excited to recommend Gaby, because I believe her strengths fit the definition of SSMs very well. When you first meet her, she comes across as someone who is extremely likeable: engaged (eye contact, smile), warm, and a very approachable sense to her. As I have gotten to know her, I have been impressed with how positive she is. We have discussed school, troubles that average freshmen deal with as they enter Tech, family dynamics and other topics. Throughout each discussion, she has been very thoughtful (I can always tell that she is really examining and thinking through thoughts) and never judgemental. She brings energy to her friend group, and her humor is light and also can connect with various people groups. I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Gaby, and she is honestly one of my favorite freshmen to spend time with this year.

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
Gaby has not had many 'difficult' experiences in her life compared to some situations she may run into (that may be poorly worded, hopefully the examples give clarity) and so there are aspects to students lives that Gaby may need training on. Examples might include potentially suicidal students or students who are in need of financial assistance. I think she would be great with any student, but training on how to best help students in need would be helpful.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
Gaby is very easy to get along with so she could work well in any group. I think the way she puts people at ease might make her suited to work well with first years. She connects well with guys and girls. Her friend group is fairly diverse. I'm sure you'll ask her this question, but it might be good insight to know whether she would feel as confident with students who are older than her.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Absolutely. She is a great candidate for this position. She is fun, she is respectful, she is always engaged and responsive in conversations, she is so sweet, she is smart, she is organized. I personally have already asked her to take on some leadership roles at CCF because I trust her. She is someone you would be thankful you hired.

Is there any additional information you would like to provide?
Other than the fact that you should hire Gaby, no.
