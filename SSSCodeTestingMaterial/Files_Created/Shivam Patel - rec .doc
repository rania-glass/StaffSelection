In what capacity and for how long have you known the applicant?
I have known this applicant on both a professional and personal level for the past two years. He's currently being trained to take over a student foundation that I am Co-President of.  

What are this applicant's strengths as a potential SSM?
This applicant's strengths are that he is very open-minded and outgoing. He's not afraid to step out of his comfort zone to try and help others. He's also very considerate of everyone and their feelings. This allows him to connect with his peers and create a bond with them. Not only does he work well with people, but he is very professional when he needs to be. He's not afraid to give orders when needed, and he also knows how to take orders from superiors. 

What are this applicant's areas of development as a potential SSM?
This applicant will develop better communication skills. At times, he has good intentions but he doesn't express them as well as he can. For example, he'll try to help someone who's having self-confidence issues, but he doesn't have enough experience with how to help them with his words.

What type of residents (mostly first-years, upperclass students, etc.) would this candidate be most successful with? Â What personalities does this candidate work most and least well with?
This applicant would work best with first-years. That is because he is very outgoing and likes to experience lots of new things. He's also a transfer student so he first-handedly understands what it's like to adjust to a new surrounding.

Do you believe the candidate would make a good SSM? Â Please explain.
Yes I believe this candidate would make a good SSM. That's because everything this candidate does, he does it with a pure heart. He's very genuine in his actions and tries to do what's best for everyone.
